Claire,"Honey, do you need me to move the car?"
Phil,"Ho, no! It's nothing. I'm alright. Oh no! Iron cross"
Claire,Oh God... Phil... You okay?
Phil,Yes. I am. I am okay.
Claire,"Honey, why do we keep this car?"
Phil,It's a classic!
Claire,"No, it just sits here. And the seatbelts don't work. The doors stick. It leaks fluids. We haven't put fluids in it in 10 years."
Phil,"Well, I'm gonna fix all that anyway. And then, uh, it's gonna be Haley's car."
Claire,"Oh, we're not giving this car to Haley. It's way too easy to fit a mattress in the back."
Phil,Remember?
Claire,"Oh, no. We're selling it."
Phil,What?!
Claire,Mm-hmm. Unless you don't think you can.
Phil,Really?
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,Seriously?
Claire,You can't.
Phil,You honestly think that's gonna work?
Claire,You can't sell it.
Phil,"You know what? You can insult a lot of things about me... My hair, my voice, my balance-board exercises... But don't insult my selling. That crosses a line. What line? Oh, you don't see it? That's 'cause I just sold it."
Cameron,"""while the spray-tanned starlet claims to be six weeks sober, sources down under say she has been bar-hopping like a coked-up kangaroo."""
Mitchell,"Ah, what's daddy reading to you?"
Cameron,"If I have to read ""the very hungry caterpillar"" One more time, I will snap."
Mitchell,"Oh, it's not that bad."
Cameron,I will snap!
Mitchell,"So, um, I laid the toolbox outside, And all the supplies are ready, And I think we are good to go!"
Cameron,Terrific.
Mitchell,Aren't you gonna change into a working man's outfit?
Cameron,"No, I'm good, And I don't think workmen really call them ""outfits."""
Mitchell,"We are building a princess castle for Lily. Uh, it's something every father wants to be able to do for his daughter. You know. And I fancy myself as a bit of a castle designer. I have done a few sketches."
Cameron,Which we have archived so we can use the kit.
Mitchell,"Mm, yeah."
Cameron,The kit.
Mitchell,"Uh, the kit. Which, uh, we're gonna do together."
Cameron,"I am petrified to do this with Mitchell. He built a couple of theater sets in college or something, and now he thinks he knows everything about building. Well, he doesn't. Every home-improvement project that we've undertaken has been a near-death experience."
Cameron,Make the appetizers. And then we'll be...
Cameron,"If an accident does happen, I hope he kills me... because I don't think I would be a very inspiring disabled person."
Gloria,"Honey, relax. She's not here yet."
Jay,You might want to play it a little cooler. You don't want to scare off your girlfriend.
Manny,"She's not my girlfriend! She's just coming over to study the life cycle of silkworms. Oh. She's here. She's here! Okay, how's my hair?"
Jay,I thought it was just a friend.
Manny,I heard that.
Jay,I wasn't whispering.
Gloria,"Manny, open the door. Make her feel welcome."
Manny,"Kelly! Good morning. Uh, I'm glad you're here. Um, this is my mom."
Gloria,Nice to meet you!
Gloria,"In my culture, mothers are very clingy to their sons. In fact, the leading cause of death among Colombian women is when their sons get married. But I'm not like that. I just want my Manny to be happy."
Gloria,"Manny, why don't you give your friend Kelly an empanada?"
Gloria,"Oh, I'm sure one won't make a difference. They're Manny's favorite!"
Manny,"I...Think I'm going to stop eating trans fats, too."
Luke,Mom? When was this from?
Claire,Oh... That's the year your dad and I went to the rose bowl.
Phil,Incredible game.
Claire,Yeah.
Luke,"Mom, you look really pretty."
Claire,"Thank you, sweetheart."
Luke,"So, what happened?"
Phil,"Well, Lukey, everyone gets older. Just 'cause parts of your mom aren't what they used to be, It doesn't me..."
Luke,"I mean, what happened in the game?"
Phil,"We got our butts kicked by penn state. The parade was awesome, though. Angela Lansbury was the grand marshal. ""good time, she wrote."""
Claire,"Okay, guys. Let's get back to it. No one's gonna buy this heap looking this way."
Haley,"Hey, mom, which one is the garbage can?"
Claire,"Um, it... Honey, you can't throw that away. It's blankety."
Haley,It's disgusting.
Claire,"No, sweetie, you loved blankety. You wouldn't go anywhere without him."
Phil,"Yeah, until Luke threw up on it."
Luke,yeah. I used to throw up all the time. Remember buckety?
Claire,"Oh! Oh, look at this."
Haley,What is that?
Claire,"We went to the beach one day, and had such a good time that he wanted to being home a jar of sunshine so he could always remember it. Do you remember, Honey?"
Luke,"Oh, no... no, no, don't... don't open it."
Alex,"You really think you trapped sunshine in there? I'm just letting you know now, I'm not taking care of him when you guys die."
Claire,Stop. It's sweet.
Luke,Still feels hot. Mm.
Phil,Hey! It's that guy who came by earlier. He was really interested. What was his name? Shoot!
Phil,"Well, you can't be in sales and not remember people's names. That's why I like to use what they call ""minimonic"" devices. They're little tricks to help you remember. Um, like t other day, I met this guy named Carl. Now, I might forget that name, But he was wearing a grateful dead t-shirt. What's a band like the grateful dead? Phish. Where do fish live? The ocean. What else lives in the ocean? Coral. Hello, ""coral."""
Claire,"I think it's ""mnemonic."""
Phil,I-I think I'd remember.
Phil,"Okay. You can do it, d. Okay. He looked like the drummer from Foreigner. Now, Foreigner's from France. France rhymes with ""ants."" Ants ruin a picnic. What's up, Nick? Really? Really? Well, that's great. Yeah, no, swing by anytime. We're here all day. Thanks. Guess what? You said I couldn't sell this? Well, you're gonna be eating humble pie stuffed with crow and a big side of sorry, 'cause I just did. In your face, girl with the negative tattoo! Honey... Wait."
Claire,No!
Luke,Whoa. Someone doesn't like to lose.
Phil,Honey. Honey!
Claire,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. When I woke up this morning, I hated that car, And even thinking about it made me mad. but then when we were going through it and blankety... all that stuff... I just... The thought of that whole part of our life driving away..."
Phil,We can keep blankety.
Claire,"I don't want... Look at them. Come on. A minute ago, they were babies. And now they're driving. And soon we'll all be dead."
Phil,"Whoa! You're leaving out a few great minutes there. Retirement, old age... Cool chair that goes up the stairs."
Claire,Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm...Being ridiculous.
Phil,Don't apologize. I love you when you're human. Listen. Hey! Listen! We don't have to sell the car.
Claire,"Oh, sweetie, of course we do. It doesn't make any sense to keep it."
Phil,"Well, what can I do to make you feel better?"
Claire,Nothing. Unless you can build me a time machine.
Phil,"Honey... Until someone can figure out how to keep a wormhole from collapsing in on itself, that's just a pipe dream."
Claire,"Sure. Come on back, Phil."
Mitchell,"Well, I found the... I found the nail gun."
Cameron,Oh. Yay.
Mitchell,The weirdest thing... it was wrapped in an old towel Stuffed in a box on the top shelf of the closet.
Cameron,"Well, just set it down on the counter."
Jay,Heads up!
Mitchell,"Oh, dad, what are you doing here?"
Jay,"I'm, uh, just, uh, returning that crockpot that Gloria borrowed."
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, I forgot you had that crockpot, Jay. Well, we're just getting ready to build Lily a princess castle if you... Want to help?"
Jay,"Yeah, sure."
Cameron,"Oh. Well, if it's okay with you, Mitchell."
Mitchell,"Oh, yeah! Oh, no, dad. Oh, remember how much fun we had when we built that bookshelf together?"
Jay,That was my Vietnam. And I was in Vietnam.
Mitchell,"Oh! Look at us! Three construction dudes! Dad, I'm gonna get you some workman. I have a blue and camel. What's your preference?"
Jay,Surprise me.
Manny,You think?
Manny,Okay.
Gloria,Who wants chocolate milk?
Manny,"Sure, mom."
Gloria,So how is it going?
Manny,Great! Kelly's moving her stuff into my notebook.
Gloria,This is sudden.
Gloria,Salt is for the popcorn.
Manny,That sounds good.
Gloria,You wouldn't like it.
Gloria,Okay. Here's the salt. We'll see what he likes.
Manny,"Wow! That's really good! Try it, mom!"
Gloria,I don't care for it.
Gloria,It was delicious.
Cameron,I finally got Lily down for a nap. Where is Mitchell? He's not supposed to be unsupervised!
Jay,Don't worry. I got him in the garage putting flags on the spires.
Cameron,"Okay, perfect."
Jay,It's better that way. Nobody gets hurt. We don't have to put flags on the spires.
Cameron,"yeah. All right, let's get this roof on. It's supposed to snap right into place."
Mitchell,Hey!
Cameron,"Whatcha got going on over there, jigsaw?"
Mitchell,"Well, I thought that I would get started on the, uh, drawbridge while you guys worked on the roof, so..."
Jay,You all done with the flags?!
Mitchell,"yeah! Yeah, it took me like 15 minutes. It was a lot easier than you made it out to be."
Cameron,"Do something, Jay."
Jay,"Uh, Mitch?!"
Mitchell,Yeah.
Jay,How about you make us some sandwiches?
Mitchell,"No. No, we're in the middle of this."
Cameron,"No, I think what Jay's saying is, why don't you go sort some bolts?"
Mitchell,"No, I sorted the bolts."
Cameron,All of 'em?
Mitchell,There were six. W-what's going on with you two? Are you... are you trying to get rid of me?
Jay,"Uh, ... Mitch."
Mitchell,"Oh, my god. You are. You're... you're, like, in cahoots."
Cameron,"Mitchell, I get scared. when you're around tools, honey, it's dangerous... for me, for you, for...Our roses."
Jay,"Works better this way, kid. I mean, castle goes right up, nobody gets sliced in half."
Mitchell,"Do you know how insulting this is? I was... I was an intern at the songbird summer playhouse. Do you think that the town of brigadoon just magically appeared? Well, in the play, it did, but...The set... the set was built with these two hands!"
Cameron,Mitchell. Mitchell...
Mitchell,"The Von Trapp mansion, Evita's balcony... Okay. Okay."
Cameron,"Oh, where are you going?"
Mitchell,"I'm going on a walk, And, oh, yeah, I can still do that by myself. Watch. Oh, I hope I don't get hurt. Oh, god, who put that doorjamb there? I didn't see it. I ran right into it. Oh, no, I tripped! Walking is so hard!"
Cameron,That one didn't look like it was on purpose.
Mitchell,It was!
Phil,Just a few more steps.
Claire,Oh!
Phil,"Oh, sorry! Step! Step! Sorry!"
Claire,Phil?!
Phil,Sorry. It's gonna be worth it.
Haley,"No, it's not."
Phil,Don't listen to her. And...
Claire,Ow. Ow. Ow!
Phil,Sorry. Don't struggle.
Claire,Ohh!
Phil,Stop struggling. Ta-da!
Claire,Great. It's our car.
Phil,Not a car. Kids?
Claire,"""ti..."" what?"
Phil,"Tonight, Claire Dunphy, we are turning back the clock to a simpler time... when families piled into their station wagons, picked up some burgers, and went on a picnic up to granger point."
Claire,"Honey, we don't have to do this."
Alex,Listen to her.
Phil,"No, it's gonna be great. I talked to... France, ants, picnic... Nick, and he's not picking up the car till tomorrow. We have one more night of family fun!"
Luke,What's gonna be fun about it?
Phil,Only everything.
Alex,Only nothing.
Claire,"Okay, kids, you know what? Your father is trying to do something nice, so I would appreciate it if you would stop your whining and just get in the car. Still does it! Oh, my! Come on, get in, get in!"
Phil,Ohhh!
Jay,"I'm just saying, the kid's gotta learn to let things go."
Cameron,"Well, this is a touchy subject for Mitchell. He wants to feel like a regular Joe, like you and I. Oh, pardonnez-moi. I prefer the champagne Dijon to the standard yellow. You know, there are a few areas that define us as men, like sports and construction. Mitchell just wants to feel like he's... Part of the man club."
Jay,Isn't that where you guys met?
Cameron,"I know you're making a joke because you're uncomfortable, So I'll let it slide, and we met at an orgy. Come on."
Jay,"I just think it's crazy, that's all. So what if he can't swing a hammer? Look at all he has done. Law school, great career, providing for his family. That's manly, too, isn't it? I mean, the classical sense."
Cameron,"Well, yes, I mean, I think it also takes a big man to quit his career as a music teacher and raise a child."
Jay,"You're a man, too, Cam."
Cameron,"Thank you, Jay. Wait. Garnish. We're men... not cavemen."
Mitchell,"My great-great-grandfather helped build the Brooklyn bridge. And I heard that, until the day he died, every time he passed it, he was filled with such pride. He'd say, ""there's a little bit of me in that bridge."" I know that I'm not the handiest guy, But I'm still a man, and I want to be able to look out into my yard and say... ""there's a little bit of me in that princess castle."""
Mitchell,"Oh, no. No. No, no, no. No. No. Oh, no."
Manny,"Hey, mom. Kelly's parents are on their way. She invited me to go out to dinner and a movie with them. Is that okay?"
Gloria,"Oh, but... I thought that you and I were going to the movies tonight. You know, to see that movie with Shia Lebeouf."
Manny,"Well, maybe we can go to the movie another night. W- what's wrong?"
Gloria,"Oh, nothing. Just my heart."
Gloria,"Okay, sue me. I am a Colombian mother. I'm not gonna let him make a mistake that is gonna affect him for the rest of my life! His life!"
Gloria,"Manny, I think we should talk about this Kelly girl."
Manny,Isn't she great? I think she really likes me.
Gloria,"Why wouldn't she like you, baby? Of course. go. Have fun."
Manny,I'm gonna wear my burgundy dinner jacket.
Gloria,Of course you are.
Cameron,I say we apologize and just finish the castle together like he wanted.
Jay,Did you hide the nail gun?
Cameron,Absolutely.
Jay,"'cause, I mean, you said that before."
Cameron,"No, I... Oh, my gosh. It's finished."
Jay,What the hell? Mitchell did that?
Mitchell,"Yes. Yes, Mitchell did it. Who's the bitch now, bitches?"
Cameron,"Honey, it looks beautiful!"
Mitchell,"Well, yeah, because when you two were inside enjoying your little tea party, I was out here... out here getting stuff done."
Cameron,I'm sorry. We shouldn't have underestimated you.
Jay,"You know he's stuck in there, right?"
Cameron,"Oh, yeah."
Jay,"Uh, hey, kid, Cam and I are gonna go crack a couple cold ones. You want to join us?"
Mitchell,"No, no, you know what? I'm just gonna stay here and get some stuff done, But you... you two ladies enjoy your light beers."
Jay,How do you know we're having light beers?
Cameron,"We only have light beers. So, well, listen. Here is a hammer."
Mitchell,"I don't need it. I don't need it, though."
Cameron,... and this is a screwdriver...
Mitchell,But I'm not gonna use it.
Cameron,... and you just come on in whenever you want to.
Jay,You sure we shouldn't get him out of there?
Cameron,"No. He would never forgive us. He's a very proud man, your son."
Mitchell,"Bird! Bird! Bird! Ah, oh, my god! Oh, my god!"
Jay,"Yeah, I'm pretty proud of myself right now."
Mitchell,"Ohh! Oh, my god!"
Jay,Calm down.
Claire,"Luke, honey, slow down. No one's gonna take your food away."
Phil,"Wow, this place has really changed. Time marches on, huh?"
Phil,See that Starbucks down there? You know what that used to be?
Alex,An orange grove?
Phil,"No, a burger king. You can still see some of the architecture."
Claire,Thank you... for this. I really do feel better already.
Phil,"You can go home again, Claire."
Claire,"Oh, sweetie."
Luke,Mmm. my stomach hurts.
Claire,"Luke, honey, I told you not to eat so fast."
Luke,Ohh.
Claire,"Just sit back, relax. You're gonna be fine."
Haley,Ew! Spider!
Claire,"Haley! Haley, honey, you're standing on the back of daddy's seatbelt! Haley!"
Phil,"Oh, soft cheeses, I can breathe again."
Luke,Wait. Where'd the spider go? I really need some air.
Claire,"Okay, Alex, lower your window."
Alex,I can't. It's stuck.
Claire,I forgot about that.
Alex,Don't you throw up on me.
Haley,Don't point him at me!
Claire,"Here, I'll turn on the..."
Phil,Haley!!
Claire,Ohh! Oh-ho.
Phil,"Oh! Oh, honey, I think that's the heat."
Luke,It's in my mouth. It's happening!
Claire,"Okay, grab a bag!"
Alex,Aah!
Luke,"Oh, gosh, it smells like onions!"
Alex,My seatbelt's stuck!
Claire,"I'll help you. Oh, my god!"
Alex,Aah!
Luke,Mm.
Haley,Spider!
Phil,Haley!!
Haley,"Oh, god, he's gonna blow, mom!"
Luke,I need buckety!
Claire,"Okay, everybody get out of the car!"
Alex,Our doors don't open!
Phil,"We got ya. Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast!"
Claire,"Get out, get out."
Phil,"Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast, Dunphys! Nice and easy!"
Claire,Don't look at him! He's just gonna make you feel sick!
Phil,"Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast!"
Haley,"Oh, I looked, I looked, I looked."
Claire,"Ohh, god."
Alex,"Guys, the car!"
Claire,Whoa!
Phil,I got it!
Claire,"Oh, my god. Oh, my god... Oh, no. Oh, no. What's the plan, Phil?!"
Phil,At least I'm trying to do something!
Haley,"Dad, get off!"
Claire,"Come on, Phil! Let it go! Let it go!"
Alex,"Oh, my god!"
Claire,"Honey, let it go! Honey! Stop, stop, stop."
Phil,"No... oh, no! That's not..."
Claire,It's all right.
Phil,"I'm just... I'm just being realistic, But we're gonna need to lower the asking price."
Gloria,"Hi, Papi. You're here so soon."
Manny,Yeah. I decided to skip the movie.
Gloria,Are you okay?
Manny,"Yeah. Kelly didn't like my jacket. Plus, she ordered for me."
Gloria,"Mm, did she let you hear the specials, at least?"
Manny,No. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't get me. Do we have any trans fats left?
Gloria,Of course.
Manny,"Besides, I think there's a girl I'd rather spend time with."
Gloria,"Ohh, that's so sweet. I'm the luckiest mother in the world."
Gloria,Who's Alicia?
Manny,"She's a girl in my history class. We like to play ""six degrees of sir Francis bacon."""
Gloria,"You just tossed a woman aside, Immediately you go to the next one?!"
Manny,"No, I just..."
Gloria,"Just... just what?! This is not the way you treat women! Men are all the same. They break women's hearts, and they don't care! Men are all animals!"
Jay,"Hey, honey."
Gloria,Animal!
Phil,"The art of the sale is all about... What you leave out. ""'83 classic wagon."" Tough to find parts. ""they don't make 'em like this anymore."" For legal reasons. ""enjoyed for many years by one happy family."" Boop... of raccoons. I'm kidding. Actually... Actually, it did make us happy for a long time. It's gonna be tough to say goodbye. It always is. Nobody loves change. But... Part of life is learning to let things go."
Luke,I totally thought I was gonna puke on you.
Haley,I would have killed you if you did.
Alex,"Oh, yeah, like you killed that spider?"
Haley,"Oh, you didn't see it. It was huge."
Luke,Remember the look on mom's face when her seat fell down? How about when dad jumped on the hood of the car?
Cameron,Mitch? Lily?
Mitchell,"Hey, we're in here!"
Cameron,Oh! Princess is in her castle! How long have you guys been out here?
Mitchell,"Ohh. Cam, she can't get enough. We've been in here for like two hours."
Cameron,"Oh, wow!"
Mitchell,Yeah.
Cameron,And we did his for her. Mm. Need me to get you out of there?
Mitchell,"This thing is not safe, Cam."
Cameron,Move to the back of the castle.
Mitchell,"Yeah, no. I know the drill. No, don't carry me out this time. I think it sends the wrong message to Lily."
Cameron,"Well, the neighbors enjoy it."
Claire,How come we don't have the same number of containers and lids? Why would they ever get separated?
Phil,"Built-up resentment, money issues, met a younger lid. Huh?"
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Alex,"Mom, where's my science homework?"
Claire,"Uh, it's over there on the table. So, Alex, honey, what's going on? Anything exciting?"
Alex,No.
Claire,Any boys?
Alex,No.
Claire,"I'm feeling a little bit disconnected from Alex right now. Last week, I picked up her cellphone, thinking it was mine, and I accidentally read a few flirty text messages that were probably from a boy in her class, which is fine. Or they're from a drifter."
Claire,"Come on, isn't there something you want to share with your mommers?"
Alex,"Yeah. Don't call yourself ""mommers."""
Phil,He blew his lid when she tried to contain him.
Cameron,Okay. What do you think?
Mitchell,I like it.
Cameron,But you don't love it.
Mitchell,"No, I do. I love it."
Cameron,As much as you loved the other one?
Mitchell,Ooh.
Cameron,Okay. Mm. The house is on fire. I only have time to grab one shirt. Which one do I take?
Mitchell,The correct answer is take Lily.
Cameron,After that.
Mitchell,"Uh, okay, the blue one."
Cameron,Because the gray one washes me out.
Mitchell,"No, no. Cam, you... you can't go wrong here. Everything you've tried on looks great. I love you in both of them."
Cameron,"Oh, you're so nice to me."
Cameron,"Mitchell has a problem with public displays of affection. Um, I remember once at a new year's Eve party, Stroke of midnight, he high-fived me. Two problems with that... One, gays don't high-five. Two, gays don't high-five."
Jay,"I'm home! Mmm, what smells so good?"
Gloria,"I'm making chunchullo, a traditional Colombian dish, for dinner with the family tonight. Chunchullo."
Jay,"What is that... like, uh, tacos?"
Gloria,"Yes, like tacos."
Manny,"No, it isn't. It's the small intestine of a pig."
Jay,"Oh, geez. Why can't we eat regular food like normal people?"
Gloria,"I told you, Jay. My grandmother, who rests in peace, has been coming to me in my dreams, telling me that I'm losing touch with my roots."
Jay,"See, this is awkward, Because my dead uncle Joe told me to have steak tonight."
Gloria,"No, no, no, Jay. Have some respect. My grandmother can hear you."
Manny,"What do you mean, she can hear us?"
Gloria,"Well, in our culture, we believe that the dead are all around us."
Jay,"She's right, Manny. She could be right here, her bony fingers reaching out from the grave."
Gloria,"Yeah, keep it up, Jay. There's already one dead person in this room. You want to make it two?"
Jay,"I'm sorry. I've got a printer to install. Oh, Gloria, have your grandmother run me up an iced tea in about 10 minutes."
Gloria,"Yeah, she has a better chance of making that work than you! Why don't you save us the stomping and the swearing and call Phil? He's good at that stuff."
Jay,"Better than me? Phil's not better than me at anything, Except maybe making that stupid sound with his mouth."
Jay,You spit on me.
Claire,"Haley, honey, um, I need you to do something for me."
Haley,"Ugh. Mom, my arm hurts."
Claire,Why don't you find out what it is before you start making up excuses to get out of it?
Haley,"okay, what is it?"
Claire,I need you to talk to your sister. I think that there's something going on with her and a boy.
Haley,So?
Claire,"So, I am your mother, and it is my job to make sure that you girls don't get involved with a predator."
Haley,"Okay, mom, stop watching ""dateline."" And why can't you just talk to her?"
Claire,I have tried to talk to her. I... she won't talk to me. You know that.
Haley,That's because you get so weird every time a boy comes near us.
Claire,I-I just don't want you girls to...
Haley,To make the same mistakes that you did?
Claire,No! No.
Haley,"Mom, I'm not an idiot. I pick up on things. And I don't think that you were the good girl you pretend you were."
Claire,Wow. That is so untrue. I was a very good girl.
Claire,"Your kids don't need to know who you were before you had them. They need to know who you wish you were, And they need to try to live up to that person. They're gonna fall short, But better they fall short of the fake you than the real you."
Phil,Which is why we don't hide anything.
Claire,That's the opposite of what I just said.
Phil,I was not listening.
Mitchell,Ohh. I'll say it again... I love you in Paisley.
Cameron,"Oh, let me lock the door and draw the curtains."
Mitchell,What does that mean?
Cameron,"It doesn't mean anything. Good. You know exactly what it means. You won't kiss me in front of other people because you're ashamed of who you are. And, yes...I went there."
Mitchell,"Okay, you can't say, ""yes, I went there,"" When you go there all the time. And, by the way, I'm the one who makes speeches on airplanes every time someone looks at us weird. I'm the one who gives my dad hell when he refers to you as my ""friend."""
Cameron,That's different. That's confrontation. But you know what takes real strength?
Mitchell,Whining?
Cameron,Affection.
Mitchell,"Oh, this is insane. Buying a shirt... it's not a kiss-worthy moment."
Cameron,"Oh, I didn't know there was an official list. Please, tell us... what is on the list?"
Mitchell,"I'll tell you what's not on the list... Finding jalapeño- stuffed olives, making the light on maple, every time we see a v.W."
Cameron,"You don't like ""kiss-buggy""?"
Mitchell,It's not a real game! It... it's just another way for you to be needy. I... and I don't appreciate you making me feel bad because I can't live up to your impossible standards. Nobody kisses at a bowling alley!
Cameron,I almost got a turkey!
Phil,"""yello""? Oh, hey, jay. Just a sec. I'll go get Claire."
Jay,"Oh, actually, it's you I'm calling. What was that?"
Phil,The cat. There's a cat. What's up?
Jay,"Well, Gloria's been missing her grandmother. I've been trying to get this old picture of her printed, But I can't get this new printer to..."
Phil,"I'll be right there. Luke, grandpa needs us!"
Phil,"Hells yes, I was glad to get the call. Jay's always around here fixing things, Cracking jokes about my ""delicate hands"" or my gag response to the smell of paint. Look who needs me now... Mr. Hot- dog fingers who can't press ""print"" Without hitting three extra keys. Yeah! You're in my house now, Jay! T-technically, we'll be in his house, But we'll be in my area... of his house."
Haley,"So, I hear you have a boyfriend."
Alex,"No, I don't."
Haley,Who is he?
Alex,I'm not talking to you about this.
Haley,"Oh, come on. You're finally interesting. Just tell me."
Alex,He's not my boyfriend. It's Jeremy Reed. It's... he's just this boy that I...
Haley,Love?
Alex,No!
Haley,"Well, have you guys kissed yet?"
Alex,No!
Haley,"Well, what are you waiting for?"
Alex,I'm not waiting. I'm 13.
Haley,And you've never kiss a boy?
Alex,How old were you?
Haley,Like 11. And it was beautiful. I was in Jackson Kaner's carpeted garage.
Alex,11?
Haley,"Yeah. So you better get on it, or else he's gonna think you're a lesbian."
Alex,He's not going to think I'm a lesbian.
Haley,I thought you were. You totally have the sandals for it.
Phil,"Let's see this bad boy. Oh, a p-750. Nice unit. I would have sprung for the 840, But I get it... Not everyone can handle that kind of horsepower."
Jay,"I thought maybe the cordless phone was interfering, So I unplugged it."
Phil,Good idea. Maybe we should run downstairs and unplug the toaster while we're at it.
Luke,"oh, snap, dad. Toaster."
Phil,"We're kidding. A cordless phone is 5.8 gigahertz. This is wi- fi. It's a totally different spectrum. Walk with me? Here's a little trick that I've found pretty useful with Claire. * the computer and the printer must talk, talk, talk * ""command-p"" makes the picture walk, walk, walk *"
Luke,How come it's not working?
Phil,"It should be. Okay. Uh, that should be printing. So..."
Jay,"Hey, Phil, I'm gonna get a beer, beer, beer before I hit you in the head, head, head."
Alex,"Hi, Jeremy. I want to ask you something."
Alex,"wait, don't talk yet. We've texting for a while, and it's been nice, But I feel like it's leading to something else, And I don't know if you do or not, but I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy asking for him to like her. Oh, god, that's from ""Notting hill."" So dorky. but a really underrated movie."
Alex,I'm not a lesbian. I would like for you to kiss me.
Jay,"Oh, I love watching you stir."
Gloria,Then I will stop.
Jay,What? Are you still mad at me?
Gloria,"Yes. You have to apologize for making fun of my culture, my beliefs, my chunchullo, my abuela."
Jay,"I'm sorry. If you think your grandmother's here with us, I respect that. Now, come here. Oh, grandma! Where'd you come from? We're gonna have to get you a little bell."
Gloria,"Enough, Jay! My culture is very important to me! I've been working all day to share it with your family tonight, and all you do is mock me! Just go!"
Jay,"Honey, I'm sorry. I'm just teasing you."
Gloria,"Instead of being the comedian, why don't you help me?"
Jay,What do you need?
Gloria,Slap the chicken.
Jay,Do what?
Gloria,"In Colombia, when you cook in honor of the departed, You have to scare death away from the food to protect the people that are gonna eat it. Slap it and yell."
Jay,That's the nuttiest...
Gloria,Jay!
Jay,Calm down. Give me the chicken. Here we go.
Gloria,"Mm-hmm. That's not scaring anything away. When my grand-mother used to cook, The whole house would she."
Jay,Aah! Aah! Aah!
Gloria,Louder.
Jay,Aah!
Gloria,Higher. Louder! Higher! Louder! There!
Gloria,"I made all that up. That is not a real custom in Colombia. We're not lunatics. but you mess with us, and we mess with you. That's the custom."
Gloria,Louder!
Claire,"Hey, honey. Where'd you go?"
Alex,Nowhere. Just for a bike ride.
Haley,"Oh, my god! Puh-lease tell me this text is wrong! Did you really just go over to that kid's house and try and kiss him in front of a million people?!"
Claire,"Alex, did you do that?"
Alex,You got a text?
Haley,"Oh, yeah. Everybody knows. Do you know how embarrassing this is for me?"
Alex,This is all your fault! You're the one who said I had to kiss him or I was a lesbian!
Claire,Haley! Did you say that to her?!
Haley,"Oh, don't turn this on me. Look at her shoes!"
Alex,Ugh! I'm never going back to school now.
Claire,"No, sweetheart. Yes, you are. You are going back to school. But listen to me... Just because a boy sends you flirty texts doesn't mean that you have to text him back..."
Alex,what?! You read my texts?!
Claire,I...
Haley,You read her texts?! That's why you made me talk to her?!
Alex,You made her talk to me?!
Claire,"I kind of feel like we're spinning out here a little bit. Look, Alex, the important thing here is that you have to be very careful how you behave around boys because it is so easy to get a reputation."
Alex,"Well, I'm sorry I'm not a perfect little good girl like you were!"
Haley,Were you?
Claire,Ohh.
Haley,Were you?! I highly doubt it!
Luke,"Don't be such a chicken, there's no ghost in here."
Manny,"I'm telling you, my mom said her dead grander was in the house. She said she felt her here this morning... in this room."
Luke,Maybe your mom's mentally ill.
Phil,who puts a router... in the attic?
Luke,Did she have a limp and a cane?
Manny,Uh-huh.
Luke,"Ghost of Manny's great-grandma, If that's really you, show yourself!"
Manny,That's her!
Luke,Aah!
Phil,Come on! Why?! Why?!!
Haley,"Hi, grandpa."
Jay,"How we doing, girls?"
Alex,Mom ruined my life today.
Claire,I didn't ruin your life. I was....
Alex,Don't even talk to me! I didn't even want to come here.
Jay,"Well, okay. Snacks and sodas are in the living room, but don't fill up... we've got intestines coming."
Claire,"Uh, dad, if you're looking for your shoes, I think I know where they are."
Jay,"This happens to be a Colombian custom... walking in the footsteps of the ancestors, blah, blah, blah. Beats slapping the chicken."
Cameron,"Here, I brought you a drink."
Mitchell,"Oh, wait a minute... sip it first."
Cameron,"I'm not mad at you. I thought about it, and maybe you're right. I can be a little needy sometimes."
Mitchell,"Oh, well, I-I appreciate that. And you're probably not entirely off base. I mean, lord knows I-I've got my quirks. And I- I'm not the most demonstrative guy around, But I'm... I'm working on it."
Cameron,And I'm gonna help you with it.
Mitchell,Good. Just don't give up on me.
Cameron,Never.
Gloria,"Okay, everybody, let's gather around! Jay, come here. Tonight we dine on the traditional Colombian recipes of my abuela, my grandmother. And even though she's no longer with me, I am very happy because I have all of you. To Ana-Maria Rosa de la Immaculada Jimenez Morales."
Cameron,"That was beautiful, Gloria, just like my Mitchell."
Mitchell,Just slipped right off there.
Gloria,"Ay, Cameron, what happened? One moment you were there, the next, only shoes."
Cameron,I'll tell you what happened... Mitchell is embarrassed to kiss me in front of other people.
Mitchell,"No, you ambushed me!"
Claire,"Oh, Cam, come on. Don't take it personally. When Mitchell was in high school, He was dating this girl... Robin Schier. He would never kiss her, either."
Mitchell,That's because I was gay.
Cameron,What's your excuse now?
Gloria,"Ay, Cameron, it's not Mitch's fault. He gets it from his father. Jay doesn't like the lovey-dovey in public, either."
Jay,"I can't believe you're coming at me right now. I'm standing here with shoes around my neck, And for the better part of a half- hour, I screamed the death out of your meat. Now, what do you want from me?"
Gloria,Don't you see? It's because of you that your son cannot kiss his own lover.
Mitchell,"Don't say ""lover."""
Cameron,"we don't like ""lover."""
Jay,Can we just eat?
Claire,No. Tell Mitch that it's okay to kiss cam in front of you.
Jay,Why is that something we have to do?
Mitchell,We don't.
Cameron,Of course we don't.
Mitchell,"Oh, I'm sorry that I don't want to make out with you in front of my whole family."
Jay,No need to apologize.
Claire,"Oh, Gloria is right. Dad, you being so emotionally closed off makes it very difficult for your children to show affection."
Jay,Really?
Claire,Yes.
Jay,You had trouble showing affection in public places?
Claire,Yes!
Jay,You?
Claire,Yes.
Jay,"Was that before or after you were delivered to my door in a squad car, Wearing nothing but your underwear and a police blanket?"
Haley,"Oh, my god. What?"
Alex,You were arrested?
Luke,Awesome!
Claire,Not awesome. And I wasn't arrested. Your grandfather was just telling a joke.
Jay,It was just a joke. I got a million of 'em.
Claire,Dad.
Phil,"I did it! It's printing! I had to download new firmware, install new drivers, Change your encryption, and replace an ethernet cable in a 100-degree attic, while dodging particularly aggressive spiders, But I did it!"
Jay,Thanks.
Phil,Oh. Okay. I guess that's it.
Jay,What? What's it?
Gloria,"Wake up, dummy. This is what we're talking about. This guy's been working like an imbecile all day for you. People need something else... kisses, hugs."
Jay,"What, for fixing a printer?"
Phil,"Oh, it's fine. It was only four hours. I tipped over a paint can and threw up a little, but I think... I think ""thanks"" about covers it."
Jay,"Well, what's wrong with ""thanks""?"
Claire,"It's pretty much the bare minimum, dad."
Manny,"Jay, for god's sakes, just say something."
Jay,"You want me to say something? How about ""you're welcome""? How about ""I'm... I'm so happy to be here for you all so I can take the blame for all your crap."" I can't do this, I never did that. Trust me, I gave you twice as much as my father ever gave me. The man kissed me one time in my entire life. He came up behind me, kissed me on the back of the head, Said, ""goodnight, Becky."" He thought I was my sister."
Gloria,Wait a minute. When was the last time you kissed Mitch?
Jay,What does that have to do with anything?
Gloria,"Mitch, when was the last time he kissed you?"
Mitchell,I-I don't remember.
Jay,It wasn't that long ago.
Mitchell,I was 12.
Gloria,"12? This is the problem! Jay's dad doesn't kiss Jay, So Jay doesn't kiss Mitch, and Mitch is uptight."
Mitchell,"Okay, okay, ""uptight"" was really not on the table. This is more about kissing."
Gloria,"Jay, kiss your son. He's a mess."
Jay,"Oh, come on, now."
Mitchell,We don't have to do that. It's...
Gloria,"Yes, you do."
Mitchell,No.
Claire,"Come on. Come on, do it. You're in front of your grandchildren."
Jay,"All right, all right! Shut up! Mitch, get over here."
Mitchell,"W-what, now? Well, I feel weird now."
Jay,"Don't be coy. What are you waiting for, a box of chocolates? Let's do this."
Cameron,That's the sweetest thing I've ever seen.
Jay,"All right, and now because I never want to hear this again... you."
Phil,Ohh.
Jay,Not you.
Claire,"Oh, daddy, I love you."
Gloria,Let's go eat chunchullo!
Manny,"You know it's made of pig intestines, right?"
Claire,"Alex, wait."
Alex,What?
Claire,I want to talk to you.
Alex,"Mom, I don't want another lecture."
Claire,"It's not a lecture. I want to tell you something. Honey, I know exactly how you're feeling."
Alex,"No, you don't."
Claire,"Okay, the... the joke that grandpa told tonight? That... that happened. That...that was true."
Alex,"So, you were arrested naked?"
Claire,"I wasn't naked! And I was not arrested per se. I was driven home one night by the police because my boyfriend and I had gone swimming in somebody's pool, And we didn't have bathing suits and... blah, blah, blah, the details aren't important. What matters is that everybody at school was talking about it. And I thought I would die. But it passed. I swear. And now, honey, I'm... I'm glad it happened. I've got a funny story to tell at dinner parties."
Alex,"So, how long did it take before you thought it was funny?"
Claire,"Oh, god... 10, 15 years."
Alex,Great. What do I do about tomorrow?
Claire,"I don't think you have to worry about that. Go, go, go."
Gloria,"In Colombia, we kiss for everything because a kiss can mean so many different things."
Manny,"There's no ghost in here, is there?"
Jay,"Not a chance. Sleep easy, kid."
Gloria,"It can be the start of something new. It can be how we say, ""this is the person that I love."""
Cameron,"So who's a better kisser, me or your dad?"
Mitchell,Ew.
Gloria,It can be romantic.
Alex,If it's okay... maybe we should hang out more first. This is only the second conversation we've had that wasn't by text.
Gloria,It can also be worth waiting for.
Gloria,"Jay, what is this?"
Jay,Just another nice thing I did for you while you made a fool of me. Manny let me in on your little tricks. You feel bad now?
Gloria,No. I feel good. Mm.
Gloria,That one is definitely my favorite.
Claire,"Phil, you really don't have to do this."
Phil,"No. I-I can do it. I want to do it. It's silly to pay someone else just to do something... Oh! Oh, no! Oh!"
Claire,"Oh, wait! No, no, don't spill it! Sweetie, don't spill that!"
Phil,"Oh! Oh, that's on me!"
Claire,"Careful! Oh, gosh! Oh! Okay, get up. You're fine. Get it off! Okay, I got it. I got it."
Phil,"Got it off. Got it off. Oh, the face! Not the face! Oh, the face!"
Claire,"All right, I'll pull it down!"
Phil,Ohh!
Claire,You're good!
Phil,It's on me.
Claire,"All right, I'm gonna have to... I'll cut it off."
Phil,"Good idea. Get a bucket, please!"
Haley,"Oh, my God, mom, the party is like 'round the block. I'd be gone for two hours."
Claire,That is two hours you could spend studying.
Haley,"I had been studying all weekend. No friends, no phone, just me alone with books. I feel like Alex..."
Alex,You're never alone when you have books.
Claire,Really?
Haley,Is that what you want me to turn into?
Claire,"Sweetheart, listen to me. This is the S.A.T.S. Okay? It is not some stupid science quiz. Hey, if science quizzes are so stupid, why do you put mine up on the refrigerator?"
Haley,"Because we feel sorry for you, 'cause books are your friends."
Alex,"Yeah, she wasn't studying last night. She was video-chatting the whole time."
Haley,Shut up!
Claire,I knew it. I knew it.
Haley,You are such a tattletale!
Claire,"Girls, take it down a notch, because I..."
Phil,"whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the hot topic on ""the view"" today, ladies?"
Haley,"Dad, can you just please tell mom that I can take a two- hour break and go to a party?"
Phil,"No, ma'am. I'm not stepping into that one. We're not playing good cop/mom. I got it. You know, you just bought yourself an extra... Hello."
Phil,"Uh, no, we did not."
Claire,Oh. Yes. We did! We did!
Phil,We did?
Claire,"Plumber, hi. Yeah. Um, it's right up at the top of the stairs."
Phil,"Really, Claire?"
Phil,But didn't I tell you I'd fix the tub?
Claire,"Yes, honey, you did, And I think I was pregnant with Luke at the time."
Phil,"That is not fair. I've done everything you've asked me to do around here. I fixed the step, didn't I? Look how solid it is! I'm like Shirley Temple and that black guy!"
Phil,"Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson! I said it first!"
Claire,"So, this is the problem. Uh, faucet just keeps leaking."
Phil,"Yeah, it's a cracked washer... If I know my washers. And it's, uh, it's been leaking a little water."
Phil,"Well, I guess I'm not a professional plumber, But I have spent a huge amount of time in that tub. I can tell you from experience, or at least what it feels like in there..."
Mitchell,"Oh, good. You're back. I need you to help settle a spat between our blacksmith and the chimney sweep."
Cameron,Be nice. It took me 20 minutes to find my opera cloak.
Mitchell,I still can't believe you didn't have to rent any of that.
Cameron,"Oh, please. Do you know how many times this has paid for itself?"
Mitchell,Has it?
Cameron,"Well, our friend Pepper loves to throw theme parties."
Mitchell,"Yes, he does, and this weekend is his first annual ""Oscar Wilde and Crazy Brunch."""
Cameron,"We're still recovering From his ""Studio 54th of July"" barbecue. They were fun at first."
Mitchell,Uh...
Cameron,But they have become a lot of work. You have to dress in costume.
Mitchell,You have to assume a character. I... I can't believe you ever dated him.
Cameron,One date. It was the '90s. We'd just lost Princess Di. I was at sea.
Mitchell,"Oh, Cam, can we just... Can we please cancel?"
Cameron,"I wish we could, But you know he's still mad at us for missing passover."
Mitchell,"Oh. Right. ""Seder-day night fever""?"
Cameron,Just go get dressed and powdered.
Mitchell,Ohh. Pepper has done the impossible! He's made two gay men hate brunch.
Jay,"You know, it might be easier just to pour the espresso right in the sugar."
Manny,Every morning.
Gloria,"Jay, what are you wearing? You can't go to church like that."
Jay,"Well, that settles it, then. I'm going golfing."
Gloria,"You're gonna miss church again? Last Sunday, you said that you had to go to the office. The week before, you had breakfast with a friend."
Manny,"And before that, you thought you had a cold that turned out not to be a cold."
Jay,Because I babied it.
Gloria,You don't have to convince us. You have to convince him.
Jay,"Who, God? Me and God are good!"
Gloria,How would you know?
Jay,"Look, you feel God in church, which is great. I feel God out in nature, amongst his works."
Gloria,Are you gonna go to church next week?
Jay,We'll see.
Gloria,"I know what ""we'll see"" means. If you're done with church, just say it."
Jay,I'm done with church.
Gloria,Don't say that!
Jay,Look... I'm not going to church anymore. It's not the end of the world. Let's not make a big deal out... Hell...
Gloria,Aah! Aah!
Manny,Earthquake!
Gloria,"Iterremoto! Vamos, vamos, Manny! Vamos, Jay!"
Phil,Girls?!
Claire,"Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. This is... this is stuck!"
Cameron,We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
Mitchell,"We better not. If they find us in these outfits, It's gonna be very bad for the gays."
Phil,Claire?!
Alex,We're okay!
Luke,Dad?
Phil,Luke! Buddy. You okay?
Luke,"That thing almost fell on me! I was sitting there, And it came this close to my head!"
Phil,It's all right. You're okay. You didn't get hurt.
Luke,"Well, I'm not gonna wait around here until I do. Ohh."
Phil,O...kay. Wow! That is a doozy.
Mitchell,"Hey, are you guys okay?"
Phil,"Yeah, we're fine. You?"
Mitchell,"We're fine. That was really... Oh, wait. Hold on. Hello?"
Gloria,"Mitch, are you okay?"
Mitchell,We're okay. We're okay.
Gloria,And Phil and Claire?
Mitchell,"Uh, I'm on the other line with them right now. One second. Hello? Oh, shoot, we lost Phil."
Gloria,We lost Phil?!
Cameron,We lost Phil?
Gloria,Hello?
Mitchell,Great. Now Gloria's gone.
Cameron,"Gloria's gone, too? Ohh!"
Phil,"Hey, Gloria."
Gloria,"Ay, dios mio, Phil, you're alive!"
Phil,"Yeah, of course I'm alive. For now."
Phil,"For months, Claire has been after me and dogging me... ""what if we have an earthquake? We've got kids in the house."" Blah blah blah. So it finally reached the point where I had no choice but to just roll up my sleeves and tell her I did it."
Claire,Aah. Phil!
Alex,"Dad, get up here!"
Phil,"On my way... seriously, I just fixed that!"
Alex,Haley...
Phil,What's wrong?
Alex,Mom's stuck!
Phil,You okay in there?
Claire,We're fine. The door is jammed.
Phil,"Oh. Okay. Uh... well, let's... let's try this together, okay?"
Claire,Okay.
Phil,"Um, I'm gonna push. You pull."
Claire,Okay.
Phil,"On three. 1, 2, 3..."
Claire,Aah! Nothing!
Phil,"Oh, dang!"
Phil,"Okay, here's the thing. I wasn't pushing. In fact, I was pulling a little. It dawned on me that as long as Claire was stuck in the bathroom, I'd have time to anchor the cabinet to the wall. It's like they say... Sometimes when god closes a door, He closes it so hard that your wife can't get out."
Phil,"So, don't panic! I'm gonna get you out! I'm just gonna go get some tools!"
Phil,What is that supposed to mean? Like I'm some dandy who doesn't have a crowbar?
Phil,"""Dandy"" is a term coined by miners in the 15th century."
Claire,Phil? Just get us out of here.
Haley,"Dad, how long is it gonna take to get her out of there?"
Phil,Long time.
Claire,"Oh, honey. Don't worry. Mommy is gonna be out soon. Don't panic. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're not going to that party, young lady."
Haley,"No, I'm not going to the party. I'm just going downstairs."
Alex,With your purse?
Haley,"Come on. Just cover for me this one time, and I... I'll drive you wherever you want."
Alex,I want to go to the Museum of Tolerance.
Haley,Fine. How far is tolerance?
Claire,I can hear the two of you scheming out there! Don't you dare leave this house!
Haley,"Ohh, why do you have to be such a psycho control freak?!"
Claire,"Okay, you know what? Just for that, you are grounded one week!"
Haley,"Oh, that's good parenting!"
Claire,Okay. Two weeks. Want to double it?! Keep talking!
Haley,Blah blah blah blah blah!
Claire,Fine! Four weeks! Four!
Haley,Double it again and make it 10 weeks!
Alex,"Oh, my God! Do you not hear how much you need to study?!"
Cameron,"Mitchell, come on. We're gonna be late."
Mitchell,"Ohh, I can't believe we have to do this."
Cameron,"Come on, after the earthquake, it might be nice to be around similarly dressed people."
Mitchell,That makes no... the earthquake! Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. This...okay. This is the perfect excuse.
Cameron,Why? We're fine.
Mitchell,"Yeah, but Pepper doesn't know that. You'll just tell him that we have some damage we have to deal with."
Cameron,Why me?
Mitchell,Because I'm the one that always cancels.
Cameron,"No, do not hand me that. I will not talk to him."
Cameron,I'm a bad liar. Do not hand me that.
Mitchell,He is on the phone right now. Pick up. You are doing it! I think somebody's talking.
Cameron,Hi! Pepper! Listen... hi. Hey. It's Cameron. How are you doing over there?
Cameron,"Well, the earthquake. Yeah, it was huge here. Huge. So, obviously, we're not... We're not gonna be able to make it."
Cameron,"Well, some dishes broke."
Cameron,"And, uh, well, yeah, I guess... I guess we could sweep those up, um, later. Our, uh, our... our hat rack. Our hat rack fell through the window."
Cameron,"Well, yeah, we do have a hat rack. We thought it would force us to wear our hats more. And it did. And there's water damage. There's water everywhere. A bookshelf fell on Mitchell's leg. Mitchell's hurt, Pepper. Mitchell's hurt real bad."
Cameron,"No, you don't need to come over."
Cameron,"Pepper, no! He's coming over. See? Kind of panicked."
Mitchell,"You did panic, Cam. You panicked real bad."
Gloria,"You're still going golfing?! God sent you a sign, Jay!"
Jay,"What, the earthquake? You got to be kidding me."
Gloria,"You say that you're never going to church again, And the ground shakes with a vengeance."
Jay,"I'll prove it to you. God, if you have a problem with me golfing..."
Gloria,Shh!
Jay,"...send me a sign! I mean, throw in a little lightning! Put on a show!"
Gloria,Don't talk to God like that!
Jay,"Trust me, if God had a problem with me, he would let me know without shaking the whole city. He would be a little more specific."
Gloria,"I'm not gonna argue with you. I don't want to get upset. Vamanos, Manny."
Manny,I think I'm gonna skip it today.
Gloria,What?!
Manny,I like what Jay said about God being in nature.
Gloria,"No, no, no, no. Don't listen to him. His days are numbered!"
Manny,"Think about it, mom. It makes sense. God made the trees and the grass. He didn't make that church."
Gloria,"But he made the people that make the church, And you're making me angry! Vamanos."
Manny,Just one week. Can I go golfing with you?
Jay,"Well, I'm probably gonna have a Latino kid carry my clubs anyway. Might as well be you."
Gloria,Fine! See what I care! Go!
Jay,Manny. Go change.
Manny,"Sorry, mom. Hope you understand."
Jay,Probably good for us to spend a little time together.
Gloria,You're gonna spend eternity together!
Jay,"Ohh. Damn it! I suppose that was god, too!"
Gloria,"I don't know who did it, but it makes me happy."
Jay,Aah!
Luke,What are you doing?
Phil,"Hey, buddy. Oh, just double-checking these straps. This is an extra. These babies saved your life. That's why this cabinet barely moved."
Luke,It fell all the way to the couch.
Phil,Mnh-mnh.
Luke,It almost killed me.
Phil,"No, it didn't. This cabinet barely moved. That's just perspective playing tricks on your mind. Like if I hold up my thumb, it looks bigger than your head."
Luke,"No, it doesn't. It looks tiny."
Phil,You have to look at it from over here.
Luke,How can I look at my head from over there?
Claire,Phil?
Phil,"Why don't you just lie down? I got to make sure your mom's still stuck. So she... I can get her out. Don't fall asleep. Sorry that took... you filthy... Sorry that took so long! I'm gonna go ahead and just take off the doorknob, okay?"
Claire,Okay!
Phil,"There we go. That's... oh, damn!"
Claire,What? What happened?
Phil,"I, uh, brought the wrong screwdriver, So I'll be right back!"
Claire,"All right, but hurry up, Phil!"
Phil,"Doing my best, Claire!"
Haley,"Oh, don't talk back, dad! She'll just ground you!"
Claire,"That's 32 weeks, young lady! I was at 16 before, right? What?"
Claire,Don't judge me until you've had a teenage girl.
Claire,"God, how did you survive that?"
Claire,"Well, all the more reason she should listen to me. I can stop her from making the same mistakes."
Claire,"Oh, God no. But, you know, I had a reason. That woman was a psycho control... Freak."
Luke,"Hey, mom. I brought you some soda. But I couldn't find any straws, so you'll have to drink it like cats."
Claire,"Oh! Thank you, Luke! That's my sweetie."
Luke,"I was going to bring you wine, But you finished the big bottle last night."
Claire,Okay. Off you go.
Luke,I was...
Jay,"Hold this, will you, kid?"
Manny,Sure.
Jay,"You know, Mitchell used to caddy for me. Of course, he spent most of his time chasing butterflies."
Manny,You won't catch me doing that.
Jay,Good for you.
Manny,I'm terrified of them.
Jay,Huh. Look at that. That's a perfect shot. And I hit that with a bent club.
Manny,"So you're not worried about getting in trouble? You know, with god?"
Jay,"Oh, I think he's got bigger things on his plate."
Manny,So you're not worried about hell?
Jay,"Let me let you in on a little secret, kid. There is no hell."
Manny,Seriously? No hell? That's fantastic! So everyone just goes to heaven?
Jay,Yep. End of story.
Manny,Even bad people?
Jay,"Yeah, they're... they're... they're another section, see? They got this thing figured out. Can I hit this? Damn it. You distracted me."
Manny,I didn't say anything!
Jay,I could hear you thinking.
Manny,I'm thinking about this heaven of your that's full of bad people.
Jay,"Not full. The tiniest fraction, they're walled in."
Manny,What if they break out?
Jay,They're surrounded by a lake of fire.
Manny,They are fiery lakes in heaven? This is turning into hell.
Jay,Tell me about it.
Cameron,What are you doing?!
Mitchell,"Well, you promised Pepper broken dishes, so... I'm breaking dishes."
Cameron,"No! Not my frog! I know you think it's tacky, but I happen to have won this at my first 4-h summer camp in a hollerin' contest."
Mitchell,"Well, we wouldn't have to break anything if you were a better liar."
Cameron,If you're trying to make me feel bad about not being as good a liar as you... What are you doing?
Mitchell,"A hat rack fell through the window, remember? One... Two... Three!"
Cameron,"Mitchell, wait! I-I-I can't do this. I quit. You might be comfortable with all this lying, but I'm not."
Mitchell,"Oh, please. Where was all this conscience when I got us into the first-class lounge at the airport and you chewed Angela Lansbury's ear off. You know what you are? You're like a mob wife. You look down at me and my ways, But you're happy to wear the mink coat that fell off the back of the truck!"
Cameron,How dare you?
Mitchell,I know. I know. It really hit us bad.
Cameron,"Pepper, you didn't have to leave your party to come check on us. Great costume, by the way."
Cameron,"Well, about your party..."
Mitchell,"Oh, Pepper, that is horrible. I-I'm gonna make you a cocktail."
Cameron,"Well, since you brought it up, Pepper... we didn't want to come to your party, either."
Cameron,"Well, you know we love you, But they've just gotten to be so much work over the years, and..."
Mitchell,We're all out of cassis.
Mitchell,I will make you a Bellini.
Cameron,Yeah. I told him.
Mitchell,"Yeah. Yeah, I puzzled that out."
Manny,I just don't understand this bad section of heaven. What if they send you to the wrong place? They make mistakes with paperwork sometimes. I was put in a girls' health class last year an had to watch a very disturbing movie.
Jay,"Calm down. Instead of thinking all morning about what heaven's gonna look like, What it's not gonna look like, who's where, If there even is a heaven, why don't we just concentrate on this beautiful, carefree day that's in front of us?"
Manny,I'd rather concentrate on something you just said. There might not even be a heaven?
Jay,I don't know!
Manny,You seemed pretty sure of yourself this morning. So what happens after you die? There's just nothing?
Jay,"Look, you're focusing too much on one little thing that I said. It was just a hunch, okay?"
Manny,A hunch? I'm skipping church based on a hunch?!
Jay,"All right, don't freak out on me here, kid."
Manny,You're playing pretty fast and loose with my soul.
Jay,"Listen. I want you to forget everything that I said, okay?"
Manny,"Some things can't be forgotten, Jay. Do you know what menstruation is? Because I do."
Phil,Perfect. Hey!
Alex,W-what are you doing? Aren't you supposed to be getting mom out of the bathroom?
Phil,That is what I was doing. That is what I was doing. This c… this cabinet... was the problem.
Alex,How?
Phil,"Yeah. It's very heavy, And because it was properly anchored to the wall, There's sort of a ripple effect. It was... pulling part of the floor down... and then pushing part of the floor up, using the bathroom door... Please don't tell on me."
Cameron,"No, no. You're not a joke. You're Pepper Saltzman."
Cameron,"Pepper? Pepper, you... you didn't let me finish. The reason we didn't want to come to your party is... Mitchell?"
Mitchell,Seriously?
Mitchell,Who's a mob wife?
Cameron,I'm a mob wife.
Mitchell,I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Cameron,I'm a mob wife.
Mitchell,"Okay, um... Pepper, This is a little embarrassing."
Mitchell,Cameron still has feelings for you.
Mitchell,"Yeah, and it's just... it's very hard for him to be around you, especially at your... magical brunches where you're just... You're... you're so... magnetic. And then I see the way that he looks at you, and... Damn it, Pe... it just makes me so mad that I could just... Ohh!"
Cameron,Really?
Mitchell,"Yeah, oh, you don't know the pain, Cam!"
Mitchell,"Okay. Well, y-you'll forgive us, Pepper, If we sit out your next few brunches?"
Cameron,Sons? Sons?
Claire,"Okay, ready?"
Claire,I'm ready.
Claire,"All right? Go! Go! Go! Thank God. Thank God. Phil? Phil? Honey... Phil, where are you? Phil... Are you kidding me?! Not the.... Phil! Phil!"
Phil,Hey!
Claire,What happened to you? You disappeared for 20 minutes. We just had to break ourselves out of that bathroom.
Phil,I am so happy to see you. Get in here.
Claire,"Oh, no. No, no. Seriously, what happened?"
Alex,"Dad was incredible! He was running around here turning the gas line, Cleaning up broken glass, And taking care of Luke after he ran into a wall."
Claire,What?
Luke,I got scared because the cabinet didn't fall down.
Claire,Mm-hmm. Ohh. I'm sorry.
Phil,"Well, don't worry about it."
Claire,"No, I'm sorry. Oh... I was so nervous. I freaked out."
Phil,It's all right. It's all right. I think it was a little bit of a rough morning.
Claire,Yes.
Phil,Wasn't it?
Claire,"Yes, it was."
Phil,"I don't know about you guys, But I just want to relax and put my feet up. At the Museum of Tolerance. Who's in?"
Alex,I am!
Phil,You are. Okay. Let's do it.
Jay,"There's nothing mystical about an earthquake. Pressure builds, and it's released. And you just hope there's not too much damage. But it makes you realize what matters. And for me, that's my family."
Manny,I'll put in a good word for you.
Jay,"You're the best, kid."
Jay,My family and golf.
Manny,What do you walk on?
Gloria,"Ay, Manny, don't be ridiculous. The clouds."
Manny,That makes no sense. Clouds are air. You'd fall right through them.
Gloria,The clouds in heaven... they're like trampolines.
Manny,"Mm, I don't like trampolines. They make me seasick."
Gloria,"Manny, stop worrying. Heaven is a beautiful place with sunshine and rainbows and butterflies."
Manny,Butterflies?!
Gloria,"Ay, no, no, no, no."
Manny,Ahh!
Gloria,"I didn't say butterflies! Manny, there's no butterflies!"
Luke,"Oh, my God. That was so"
Phil,"I know, right?"
Claire,What?
Luke,Dad just wrote another classic one. Tell her.
Phil,"Oh! I don't know about ""classic,"" but here we go. ""If you're looking for a two-story house, I'm your man. I'll tell you one story before you buy it and then another story after."""
Luke,"No, you didn't!"
Phil,Tonight is the S.C.A.R.B.
Claire,The Southern California annual realtor's banquet.
Phil,I think they know what it is.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,"It's the mother of all Residential-real-estate banquets. Now, for the last five years, Gil Thorpe has hosted, But as luck would have it, he's having a sketchy-looking polyp remove so they've asked me to...""Phil in."" see what I did?"
Claire,"Oh, yeah."
Phil,"""Phil."" you think I should open with that?"
Claire,You betcha. You should.
Claire,"Phil is gonna bomb. It's not that he's not fun. He is so fun. He's just not funny. It's probably my fault, because I laugh at all of his jokes, with my mouth... Not with my eyes."
Phil,"""I see the great realtor Margaret Wilson is here, looking more curvaceous than ever. Talk about your balloon payments."""
Jay,"Gloria, do we have to keep this Colombia/Brazil soccer game?"
Gloria,"Yes, I haven't seen it yet."
Jay,"It's been sitting in there for five months. I mean, I can tell you who wins."
Gloria,Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!
Jay,"And what about this two-hour ""antiques roadshow""?"
Manny,I'll watch it today.
Jay,Fine. I'm gonna play some golf.
Gloria,No. What about Mirabel's daughter's quinceanera?
Jay,I honestly didn't get any of that.
Gloria,Mirabel. She works for you.
Jay,Okay.
Gloria,"Her daughter, Rosalba, is celebrating her quinceanera, Her 15th birthday. She invited us. You just going to ignore it."
Jay,"Of course not. I get this all the time. I throw it on my secretary's desk, And she sends them an Omaha steak."
Manny,"Ay, Jay."
Jay,What?!
Gloria,"Manny's right. The quinceanera is very important in the latin culture. The moment the father dances with his little princess. Ay, I remember my own father holding my hand. There wasn't a dry eye in the cartel."
Jay,"But these people don't want me there. See, they're just being polite. I'm the boss."
Gloria,"That's what you tell yourself so you can stay above them. You just throw them an ""Obama"" steak and run to the golf course."
Jay,"I'm not trying to stay above them. I just don't think I have to go all ""arriba, arriba"" with them."
Manny,Because you're better than them?
Jay,"No, of course not. I mean, I'm better than some of them."
Gloria,"Do you even know these people, Jay, hmm? Or they're just the backs you step on?"
Jay,"I know you like to make me out as an elitist, But the truth is, I'm close with these people."
Gloria,Then prove it. Just go to the party.
Jay,"Fine. One hour. You drive. 'cause I don't want to give my valet ticket to the wrong guy, Have you all over me."
Manny,"Ay, Jay."
Jay,Where do you keep popping out from?!
Mitchell,"So, cam has started working out again, which is... it's... it's great. He's feeling good about himself, and I want him to be healthy, so it is all good. Except for one thing."
Cameron,"Knock, knock."
Mitchell,Look who's there.
Mitchell,"Maybe there's a person in this world Who looks good in bike shorts, But my boyfriend is not that person. And I-I can't tell him because he gets incredibly sensitive about even the tiniest comment concerning his physique."
Cameron,"Hey, I think I'm gonna take this spin class tomorrow morning."
Mitchell,"Oh, sure."
Cameron,"Oh, I get it. Message received."
Mitchell,I didn't say anything!
Claire,"Okay, can't you just run like a normal person?"
Mitchell,What? It's troga.
Claire,It's what?
Mitchell,You never heard of troga?
Claire,I hate it when you do that.
Mitchell,What?
Claire,"""you've never heard of troga?"" ""you never tried octopus?"" ""you never did this amazing thing I just discovered yesterday but I pretend like I've done my whole life?"""
Mitchell,"So, troga is treadmill yoga. It's de rigueur."
Claire,It's de-dorky.
Mitchell,What is your deal today?
Claire,"I'm sorry. Phil is hosting that thing tonight, And... and he's been writing jokes."
Mitchell,"Ooh, yikes."
Claire,I know. And I'm worried he's gonna humiliate himself in front of all those important people. I can't say anything because...
Mitchell,"No, no. I get it. I get it. I get it. Because it would hurt him even more coming from you."
Claire,Yeah.
Mitchell,"You know, I'm kind of going through something similar With cam right now."
Claire,Why?
Mitchell,He's started exercising again.
Claire,"Well, that's good for him."
Mitchell,Yeah. He's wearing bike shorts.
Claire,That's bad for you.
Mitchell,"And I'm the last person who can say anything, Because he's..."
Claire,yeah.
Mitchell,"Okay, wait. No, no. All right. You know the movie ""Strangers on a train""?"
Claire,"Hm, I never saw it."
Mitchell,"You've never seen ""Strangers on a..."" I'm sorry. Great film. But it's these guys who both discover that they want someone out of their lives."
Claire,Uh-huh.
Mitchell,So one of the guys proposes the perfect crime. They will do each other's murders. We should do that.
Claire,"All right, so I would tell Cam to lose the bike shorts?"
Mitchell,Keeping me out of it. And I tell Phil to lose the jokes.
Claire,I like it. I'm in.
Mitchell,All right!
Claire,I am in!
Alex,"Hey, MacKenzie. 'sup? It's Alex. Hey, so I was thinking later we'd... Oh, no. Whatever you want. Call me later! Or I'll call you later, or..."
Haley,"So, who's MacKenzie?"
Alex,You don't know her.
Haley,"Oh, I know MacKenzie. Cute. Popular. I am MacKenzie. I invented MacKenzie. And the way she's making my sister run around... it's... it's kind of funny, but... I can't have it. It's bad for the family."
Haley,What are you doing?
Alex,I was about to call...
Haley,"Mackenzie? Yeah, I know. Now shut up and let me help you. The world is divided into two groups... Cool girls and girls like you. And you have been given a rare opportunity to move from the former to the latter."
Alex,The latter to the former.
Haley,"Whatever. Oh, my god. You're such a geek. Now, do you want to be smart, or do you want to be popular?"
Alex,I think I want to be popular.
Haley,"Of course you do. You just can't be so obvious about it. You've given MacKenzie way too much power, and you need to take some of that power back. it's her."
Alex,Give me the phone.
Haley,"Here's what you're gonna say... ""Hey, MacKenzie. I'm busy. Call me back later."" Then you hang up."
Alex,No way!
Haley,Then you're not getting the phone back.
Alex,Just give it to me.
Haley,"""Hey, MacKenzie. I'm busy. Call me back later."" then you hang up."
Alex,I can't.
Haley,Do it!
Alex,No!
Haley,Do it!
Alex,"Okay! Damn you. Hey, MacKenzie. I'm busy. Call me back later. That was hard."
Haley,"If it was easy, everyone would be popular."
Claire,"Knock, knock !"
Cameron,Come on in! It's open!
Claire,Hey! I just wanted to drop off these old baby clothes for Lily.
Cameron,"Oh, that's right. You're so sweet."
Claire,I hope I didn't come at a bad time.
Cameron,Not at all. I was just deciding where to take Lily for our bike ride... the lake or the park. I'm leaning towards the park.
Claire,I can see that.
Phil,You didn't have to do that. You guys are a touch o' class.
Mitchell,"Well, it is a big night for you, so, French."
Luke,Those guys.
Mitchell,"So, have you given any thought to what you might say?"
Phil,"Oh, actually, I'm trying not to think about my act right now. I'm kind of fighting the old butterflies, to be honest."
Luke,That's normal. I hear the Jonas brothers get scared before every concert.
Phil,Not Kevin? The guy's a rock.
Luke,Especially Kevin.
Claire,I can't believe I ever bought this for Alex. I wish somebody had said something.
Cameron,"Oh, come on. That was probably cute 10 years ago."
Claire,"No, no. It never was. And you know... I'm the exact same way about my clothes. Most of the time, great. But every now and again, there's that one outfit I just wish somebody would be honest with me and say, ""what you're wearing is in...Appropriate."" Do you know what I mean?"
Cameron,"I think I do, Claire. I think I do."
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Cameron,And my answer is yes.
Claire,Okay.
Cameron,I would love to dress you.
Claire,"No, it... I don't want you to dress me. No. And...I owe it to you to be honest, So I'm just gonna say that you need to lose the bicycle shorts."
Cameron,Excuse me?
Claire,"They're not working for you, Cam. Please don't take this personally. I mean, nobody looks good in bike shorts. I just... I feel that I owe it to you to be honest. So, we're good, right?"
Cameron,We're great. We're great. We're great.
Claire,"Oh, great. Okay. Okay."
Cameron,You should probably just show yourself. I hear... I hear some crying down the hallway.
Claire,"Look at that. That's a good dad. 'cause you've got a baby, and you hear every little sound. I wouldn't have... I wouldn't have even noticed... crying."
Phil,"Uh, okay. all right. All you need to know about this one is that skip woosnum is a well-known realtor and he's old."
Mitchell,Got it.
Phil,"Skip woosnum. Realtor. Old. Here we go. I'm not saying realtor skip woosnum is old, but the first property he ever sold... was a cave."
Phil,"You're not, uh... not laughing."
Luke,"Why aren't you laughing, uncle Mitchell?"
Phil,"'cause he doesn't think it's funny, Or maybe... maybe you don't think I'm funny. Is that what you're saying, Mitch?"
Mitchell,"No, it's... I just got it! Oh. Cave!"
Phil,That one's kind of a thinker.
Mitchell,Yes!
Jay,"There he is. All right, now."
Gloria,"Knock it off, Jay. You don't know anyone's name here."
Jay,Are you kidding me? Carlos!
Gloria,Lucky guess.
Jay,I'm lucky only one turned around.
Jay,"Listen... I need a favor. I overestimated the number of people I know at this party. So you go around, introduce yourself, and I'll hear the names."
Manny,You realize you're asking me to help prove my own mother wrong.
Jay,I'll pay two bucks per introduction.
Manny,"All right, well, that's Ramona. She's crazy for bingo."
Jay,Ramona.
Gloria,What's going on next door?
Gloria,Another Quinceanera ?
Jay,"Gloria! Stop being such a snob. Come over and meet my friend Julio and his wife... Uh, I'm sorry. Your name again?"
Jay,I think you're really gonna hit it off with Kay!
Gloria,Mm-hmm.
Cameron,"I mean, she's gonna tell me how to dress?! She ought to stick to things she knows more about, like overcooking salmon."
Mitchell,"Okay, wait. So, she actually said that you don't look good in bicycle shorts?"
Cameron,Yes.
Mitchell,"""you don't look good in bicycle shorts."""
Cameron,Madness.
Mitchell,"Oh, and here she is."
Cameron,"Okay, you know what? I can't be here. I'm... I'm going out for some air."
Mitchell,"Yes. Yes, go. This... this could get ugly. Hello, Claire. You are a gutless weasel. Oh, yeah. No. I heard what you said to my boyfriend."
Claire,You told Phil he was hysterical! You said he was this generation's Richard Pryor!
Mitchell,"Well, I am not the one that you need to apologize to. What are you babbling about?"
Claire,You owe me a murder.
Mitchell,"Okay, Claire, I c... I couldn't do it. I couldn't crush Phil's dreams."
Claire,We had a deal. I told Cam about the bike shorts.
Mitchell,"No! No! The deal was to get Cam to take off the bike shorts. But guess what... he is still in the stupid bike shorts. Can I call you back? Turns out Cam was here the whole time, and he just heard everything I said."
Claire,Ooh. Did he just run into the bedroom and cry?
Mitchell,"Oh, yes, 'cause that's what all gay men do. We all dissolve into... Yes. That is what he did."
Claire,There are challenging moments in every marriage. Um...Having to tell your husband that he's not funny So that he won't humiliate himself has to be one of the toughest. So I went a different way.
Cameron,Stop talking. I just need some time for this wound to become a scar.
Mitchell,"I'm sorry I got Claire involved, But... and this is not a criticism, But sometimes you can be a little sensitive about your...Appearance."
Cameron,"Well, this is a criticism... Sometimes you can be insensitive about everything."
Mitchell,"Oh, I-I just... Cam, I just feel like our relationship's strong enough to survive a little candor. I mean, look, you could tell me if there's something about me you'd like to change."
Cameron,I hate your beard.
Mitchell,"Wow. Well, you had that bullet in the chamber."
Cameron,"I never said anything because I never wanted to hurt you... But I've always found your beard off-putting. See? Hurts. Mitchell? Mitchell, get back here! What are you doing?"
Mitchell,I'm shaving off the bear.
Cameron,Seriously?
Mitchell,"Yeah, well, the man I love doesn't like it, so off it goes."
Cameron,"Well, good."
Mitchell,Good.
Cameron,Great.
Mitchell,Great. Okay. one... Two... Three.
Cameron,"Wait! The fact that you're willing to do it is enough for me. I love your beard. I love that when you drink cappuccino, you get foam in it and when you're nervous, your little... hairs twitch."
Mitchell,"Well, you couldn't have told me before took a notch out?"
Cameron,"I'm sorry. I-I... listen. I know... I can be touchy about... this. But you're this amazing-looking guy, and..."
Mitchell,I am not amazing... Really?
Cameron,I wouldn't change anything.
Mitchell,"Oh... You should know that every day, I wake up very grateful to have you in my life. I'm the one who got lucky, handsome. Maybe I just don't show it enough."
Cameron,"Well, you can make it up to me by doing my shoulders."
Mitchell,Sure.
Cameron,"I meant a massage. What are you saying? Oh, Mitchell. Mitchell."
Alex,It's MacKenzie.
Haley,Again.
Alex,"She wants me to come to this party she's throwing, she texted me earlier."
Haley,"You texted her back, right?"
Alex,No.
Haley,Wow. I'm... Proud? Tell her you'll try and come.
Alex,Right.
Haley,And then when she says...
Alex,Haley... I got this. Hey. Who's this?
Haley,Brilliant.
Alex,"No, I didn't see it. I get a lot of texts."
Haley,I have a sister.
Alex,"When's the party? I'll try and come. You know, I'm kind of busy. I have a life. You know, stuff. Homework."
Haley,Uh-oh.
Alex,"I mean, not homework. It's not work if you love it."
Haley,"Oh, god. Hang up. Hang up."
Alex,"Shut up! Not you, MacKenzie."
Haley,Drop the phone and kick it over here!
Alex,"Um, I have to go. I-I'll call you later. or you call me later. Love you! Aah!"
Haley,Aah!
Phil,They were right in here!
Claire,"I know, and we looked everywhere, honey, So just calm down."
Phil,"Are you kidding me? ""Calm down""? In one minute, I'm gonna be standing up there like... Like a... Oh, my god. I have no material at all."
Claire,"Okay. You're gonna be fine. You don't need jokes. Listen to me, honey. Get up there. Be your charming self. Make the introductions from your heart, and get out. You're gonna... you're gonna be amazing, okay? Mwah!"
Claire,Go. Go.
Phil,Good evening. I would not be here tonight if not for the hard work of the S.C.A.R.B. Board of trustees...
Phil,I didn't have my jokes. What choice does a guy have but to play it straight?
Phil,"...The support of my family, and Gil Thorpe's colon. But Phil Dunphy is no straight guy. So many giants of residential real estate here tonight. And, of course, J.J. Mccubbin. I'm not saying J.J. is small, but in the realty section, he was described as ""charming."" Mark Simon, you out there? There's Mark. How are you, buddy? Mark recently moved into a new model. How are you, Francine? I kid, Mark Simon. I kid, Mark Simon. You know that."
Jay,"Trancito, little Manuel, and Carlos, my wife, Gloria."
Gloria,Nice to meet you. We have to talk.
Jay,"Un momento. You know, I... I can't believe you never met them."
Gloria,"You've never met any of these people. You don't know anyone in this room. Vamos, Jay."
Jay,"I'm not leaving before the father/daughter dance. And ""these people,"" as you call them, are not just employees. They're mi familia, or ""my family."""
Gloria,"I know what ""mi familia"" is, Jay."
Jay,"Oh, I was afraid of this."
Jay,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. I'm gonna make this brief. I know a lot of you out there don't even know who I am. As my lovely wife, Gloria, pointed out, that's my fault, not yours. I'm Jay Pritchett, El jefe. Listen... on this very, very happy occasion, I'd like to pick up the tab on the bar. You know, when I started this company... ...The first thing that I... What? Oh, right. Right, now. Good. Yeah. It is not about me. This is about a very special young lady and the man who loves her more than anyone else on earth. Isn't that lovely? That's a beautiful, beautiful thing. You know, I'm reminded of when I used to dance with my little girl. But not like that. Slow down, there, muchacho. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What, are you applauding this? You're applauding this? I don't care what kind of tradition this is. This is gonna stop. Hey, hey, hey, hey. No! No! What? What? Am I the only one seeing this?!"
Gloria,V-v-vamos!
Phil,"I mean, honey, I am not kidding when I tell you there was a woman next to me gasping for breath."
Claire,"Seriously, you were so freaking funny, Phil. I have seen professional comedians who could never have done that. You were unbeliev..."
Phil,"I know it was you, Claire. You stole my index cards."
Claire,"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I thought I was protecting you. And if my plan had been successful, I would have robbed you of the greatest night ever. I'm sorry I'm awful."
Phil,"You're not awful. Claire... I love that you're looking out for me, and know why you worry about me. But I knew I had this tonight. I know."
Claire,Sometimes I just think my job is to make sure you guys don't fall on your faces.
Phil,That's a hard job in the Dunphy house. We fall a lot.
Claire,I know.
Phil,Maybe your real job is to be the person who picks us back up. Nobody does that better than you.
Claire,Thank you. Alex.
Alex,I have no friends.
Phil,You're on the clock.
Claire,Mm. All right. What happened?
Luke,"Oh, my gosh, mom. You're killing me."
Claire,"It's pretty good, right?"
Luke,"Pretty good? You could be, like, in Vegas."
Phil,Well... W-w-what's going on there?
Luke,Mom does the funniest impression of that weird lady at the supermarket.
Phil,"Oh, yeah. I know her. Let's hear it."
Claire,"Okay. Um... ""It's cheaper if you buy two jars of pickles."""
Luke,It's like she's right here!
Phil,I know! Yeah.
Phil,That's not what she sounds like.
Manny,Mom. The dog again...
Gloria,"I know Papi, I want to strangle that crazy old thing."
Jay,Just ignore it.
Gloria,It's easy for you to ignore because you have the old-man hearing. But Manny and I... we have the young ears.
Jay,I don't get how one dog keeps you awake when you grew up sleeping through cockfights and revolutions.
Gloria,"Mm-hmm. Very funny, Jay. Manny hasn't been able to sleep in weeks. It's screwing his brain for school. And it doesn't stop. It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on."
Jay,"Yes, that could be annoying."
Gloria,That's it. I'm going over there.
Jay,"Gloria, now, don't go starting something. Because whenever you do, I'm the one that... that, she couldn't hear."
Mitchell,They're gone. Cam. All the children are gone.
Cameron,What children?
Mitchell,"I was running in the park, and I noticed that none of the kids Lily usually plays with were there."
Cameron,"Well, it's still early."
Mitchell,But then I ran into Lori.
Cameron,Boobs Lori or adult-braces Lori?
Mitchell,Great-shoes Lori.
Cameron,"Oh, I like her."
Mitchell,And she said that they all sent their kids to preschool.
Cameron,What?! We agreed to wait till next year.
Mitchell,It was a fake-out to make sure that their kids got a spot.
Cameron,Those skinny bitches.
Mitchell,"We have got to get her into school, Cameron, Or else she's gonna fall behind."
Cameron,Don't you think I know that?
Mitchell,"Oh, this is perfect. Oh, leave it to the gays to raise the only underachieving Asian in America."
Claire,"Okay, here you go. Guys, breakfast. Guys. Phil. Hello."
Phil,"Totally with you. Kids, put your dishes in the dishwasher."
Claire,"Okay, no. That's it. Everybody, gadgets down now!"
Haley,Why are you freaking out?
Claire,"Because you're all so involved with your little gizmos, Nobody is even talking. Families are supposed to talk. What are you doing that's so important?"
Phil,"Oh, I'm locking in my fantasy roster. I'm unbeatable. We're totally getting an aboveground pool."
Luke,"Die, stupid, die!"
Claire,"Luke, I told you to put that down now. Come on, buddy."
Luke,One second. I'm about to beat dad's record.
Phil,You heard your mother. Claire ; What is so funny?
Alex,"Nothing. ""mom's insane."""
Claire,"Thank you, Haley."
Haley,At least we talk.
Claire,Hello.
Mitchell,"Hey, it's me. What's a good preschool?"
Claire,"Uh, well, our kids went to Wagon Wheel."
Mitchell,And it was good? You liked it?
Claire,"Oh, well, you know my kids are middle-management material at best. Didn't want to waste a lot of money... Yes, Mitchell, it's good. Why the interest?"
Mitchell,"I just realized that all of Lily's friends are going to school this year, and now she's late."
Claire,"Don't worry. She can wait another year. Just buy her a Blackberry, that's all she's gonna want to do anyway."
Cameron,What did she say?
Mitchell,She says to buy her a Blackberry.
Cameron,"Lily doesn't have the dexterity for that, Claire!"
Claire,What is happening?
Mitchell,Can you just check with your school and see if maybe you can get us in?
Claire,Hmm. I-I can probably get you an interview.
Mitchell,"Oh, no. That's great. That's great. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Oh, and, by the way, what do you think of that place Billingsley academy?"
Claire,Ooh. Billingsley. Very hoity-toity. You can't get in there unless you're really rich or you know somebody on the board.
Mitchell,"Oh, god, this is a nightmare."
Claire,"Mitch, it's preschool. Don't overthink it. My kids didn't go to Billingsley, and they are fine. I have to go. Phil. that's awesome."
Gloria,Buenos días.
Gloria,We haven't formally met. I'm Gloria Pritchett from next door.
Jay,"Wait a minute, then tell me."
Gloria,"Your dog doesn't stop barking. All morning, all night. He wakes my son up, and he needs his sleep."
Jay,Is she coming back for it?
Gloria,"Well, you need to do something about the dog."
Manny,"Who are you really mad at, Larry? The dog or your wife?"
Jay,"Hey, there's no need for that."
Gloria,"I'll tell you who he is. His name is ""shut up your damn dog""!"
Jay,Parrot?
Gloria,What parrot?
Gloria,Jay! Jay! Jay!
Gloria,What is he talking about? What parrot?
Jay,How the hell do I know?
Gloria,"So, what do we do now?"
Jay,Nothing. We did it. He heard us.
Gloria,"He didn't hear nothing. Jay, don't go. Jay! Jay! Jay!"
Claire,"Okay, we have called this family meeting because the personal electronics have gotten out of control. Starting today, there's going to be a one-week ban on all cellphones, texting, Im'ing, video chatting, video-gaming, Anything on the internet."
Alex,How am I supposed to do my homework?
Claire,The way I did.
Phil,With a chisel and a piece of stone.
Claire,Phil.
Phil,Can't unplug my funny bone.
Alex,I have a huge science paper due.
Claire,And we have a great set of encyclopedias...somewhere. What do you think the public library is for?
Haley,I thought that was a bathroom for homeless people.
Luke,Can I still play plants vs. Zombies?
Claire,Are you not listening?
Luke,But you learn about plants. And plants are life. Are you against life?
Haley,How am I supposed to talk to my friends?
Claire,Talk to them at school.
Phil,Or at a juice bar.
Claire,Or on the house phone.
Haley,Nobody even knows our number. I don't even know our number.
Alex,"So, you're saying dad's not going to go online?"
Claire,Yep.
Alex,Dad?
Phil,That's right.
Alex,What about fantasy football?
Phil,"Not a problem. My team's set this week. I am completely on board with your mother's horse and buggy to yesteryear. for the next week, I may as well be Amish. Jebediah Dunphy. Raising barns, witnessing murders, Making electric fireplace hearths."
Haley,Oh! This is so unfair!
Phil,"You know what? We're gonna make this fun. Turn it into a game. Whoever stays unplugged the longest, wins."
Claire,"Not what I had in mind, Phil."
Alex,What do we win?
Phil,What do you want?
Alex,I want a new computer.
Phil,Done.
Claire,We're gonna get them off of electronics with the promise of more electronics?
Luke,I want chicken pot pie. And chicken.
Haley,I want a car.
Claire,No way!
Phil,Done!
Haley,"Yeah, I'm getting a car!"
Phil,"Yeah, fun, right?"
Claire,Phil! We cannot afford a third car.
Phil,Relax. They're never gonna last as long as us.
Claire,"Oh, honey, don't take this the wrong way, But I have almost no faith in you."
Cameron,Okay. Thank you.
Mitchell,Thank you. Thank you.
Cameron,I really like this place. Look at all these drawings.
Mitchell,I know.
Cameron,And did you see the duckies in the yard? Lily loves duckies.
Mitchell,I know.
Cameron,I'm gonna mention that.
Mitchell,"Okay, well, do, because that's really gonna set her apart from the rest of the kids."
Cameron,"Oh. We should also mention how she always perks up when we watch ""Charlie Rose."""
Mitchell,That was one time. He was interviewing Elmo.
Mitchell,"Oh, I'm sorry. We just... we really want to make a good impression."
Mitchell,Really?
Cameron,"I hear that, girl."
Jay,I'm coming!
Gloria,Who is it?
Jay,It's our neighbor.
Jay,Maybe it ran away.
Gloria,Maybe your wife took it.
Jay,Then what do you want from us?
Jay,I'll tell...
Gloria,"How dare you? You come to our house, you ring our bell many times, and you accuse us of taking your dog."
Jay,You should go home.
Jay,"Yes, we are. What did you do?"
Gloria,You don't want to know.
Jay,"Gloria's grandfather and uncles were butchers, so she's always had a certain comfort level when it comes to...Killing. One time, we had this rat..."
Gloria,"What? First you smash it, then you cut the head off."
Jay,It was like nothing to her.
Gloria,I go to church now.
Jay,She left the head out there to send a message to the other rats.
Phil,Hey.
Claire,"Hi, honey. How was your day at work?"
Phil,Amazing.
Claire,Mwah. Great. What happened?
Phil,"Instead of wasting my lunch hour surfing the web, checking football stats, I put on some mellow music, And I meditated."
Claire,Wow. For how long?
Phil,I have no idea. I just woke up 20 minutes ago.
Haley,"Hey, mom. I need a bar of soap and a black marker for an art project."
Claire,"Okay. Well, the marker's over there, And the soap is under the sink. Isn't it great how much time you have now that you're not wasting it online?"
Haley,"Oh, my god. Is this what you always sound like?"
Luke,"Look what I built, dad. Dunphy towers. 200 condos, a happy family in every one."
Phil,"Way to go, buddy. I got to hand it to you, honey. 24 hours without video games, He's already contributing to society."
Luke,Die! Die!
Claire,"To be fair, he's using his imagination."
Luke,There's no fire escapes! They cut corners! I'll cut your corners!
Claire,"Hello? Oh, hi. Luke, honey, it's for you. Hi, Griffin. How are you? Yeah, he's right here. Hold on."
Luke,"Hey, Griffin. Oh, my god!"
Claire,What happened?
Luke,There's a parasailing-donkey video on Youtube.
Phil,"Oh, my god!"
Claire,"Wait, Luke. What about the contest?"
Luke,"I quit. I'm not made of stone, you know."
Alex,"Uhh! I can't believe it. I got a ""b"" on my paper."
Phil,Good for you.
Claire,Yeah.
Alex,"No, it would be good for you. It's terrible for me. Thanks to your moldy encyclopedias, my take on mitosis was completely out of date. They don't even call it protoplasm anymore. It's cytoplasm."
Claire,"Well, you could have asked one of us."
Alex,Now you're making jokes?
Claire,I'm not making a joke.
Alex,Really? What's the difference between a gamete and a zygote?
Phil,"Don't fall for it, Claire. She's just making up words."
Claire,Huh.
Alex,That's it. I need the internet. I'm out of your stupid contest.
Haley,Hmm. And then there were three.
Phil,She's kind of scary.
Claire,We're not buying her a car.
Jay,"Hey, buddy, what you reading?"
Manny,"""The old man and the sea."""
Jay,You like it?
Manny,I like that Hemingway gets to the point.
Jay,You read a lot of his stuff.
Manny,"That was a hint, Jay."
Jay,"Oh. Oh, okay. I want to ask you something... between you and me."
Manny,You want to know if I think my mom did something to that dog.
Jay,Yeah.
Manny,Sit.
Jay,Don't most kids drink soda?
Manny,Who knows what they do?
Gloria,"So, your mom."
Manny,"Jay, I've learned a few things in my 12 years. Don't skimp on linens, don't compliment a teacher on her figure, And when it comes to my mom, never ask questions I don't want the answers to."
Jay,I don't buy it. Sensitive kid like you. I think you want to know every bit as much as I do.
Manny,You're wrong.
Jay,Then why is your hand shaking?
Manny,This is my fifth one of these today. I may have a problem.
Jay,Okay. That's enough.
Mitchell,"No, no, no, 4:00 tomorrow is fine. Yeah, my life partner and I will see you then. Thank... thank you."
Cameron,Since when do you call me your life partner?
Mitchell,Since a spot opened up at Billingsley academy.
Cameron,But I liked Wagon Wheel. It had all the duckies. And it reminded me of where I went in Missouri.
Mitchell,"Cam, everyone goes to Billingsley for a reason... It's the Harvard of preschools."
Cameron,She's not even 2 years old yet. She doesn't need the Harvard of preschools. She needs finger painting and duckies.
Mitchell,"I'm begging you to please just say ""ducks."" Hello?"
Claire,Great news. Wagon Wheel loved you. You're in.
Mitchell,Oh. Wagon wheel wants us.
Cameron,"Oh, yes!"
Mitchell,"Okay. Well, that's great and everything, but actually we have an appointment tomorrow at Billingsley."
Claire,Really?
Mitchell,"Yeah, apparently we are in very high demand."
Claire,"Oh, well, just so you know, I don't think Wagon Wheel is gonna hold a place for you."
Mitchell,"Well, I think we're gonna take our chance."
Claire,"Take our chance? That sounds chancy. You know, Mitchell, you were the one who called me in a panic. You were the one who needed me to get you in."
Mitchell,"I'm sorry, Claire. I didn't mean to put you out. But let's not get too dramatic here. You wrote an e-mail."
Claire,It wasn't an e-mail. It was a phone call from a land line.
Cameron,What did you do?
Mitchell,What's best for Lily.
Cameron,Did you?
Mitchell,"Cam, this is the first time that being gay is a competitive advantage. They're choosing teams for gym class, And we're finally getting picked first."
Cameron,I always got picked first. I could throw a dodgeball through a piece of plywood. But I see your point.
Jay,Hey. Don't sneak up on me like that. What are you doing out here?
Manny,You got in my head about my mom. Is that the rat shovel?
Jay,Yeah.
Manny,Are you checking it for signs of dog?
Jay,I was going to.
Manny,"Well, let's do this quick. If she catches us, we're as dead as that dog probably is."
Gloria,What are you doing here? Nothing.
Gloria,"Why are you looking at that shovel? Do you think someone did something with that shovel, Manny?"
Manny,He thinks you killed the dog.
Jay,You little rat.
Manny,Don't call me a rat! She kills rats!
Gloria,You really think that I would kill a dog?
Jay,"Well, what was I supposed to think?"
Gloria,I don't know. How about I didn't kill a dog?
Jay,Just tell me what you did with it.
Gloria,He's in a better place.
Jay,That's what people say when something's dead.
Gloria,"Okay, fine. I took him to a farm where he has plenty of room to run."
Jay,That's the second thing people say when something's dead.
Gloria,My hairdresser's brother has three kids. They live in the country. They were so happy to have the dog that they gave me a jar of pickles. Is that also what they say when something is dead?
Jay,Really?
Gloria,"Look. Look how happy they are, Instead of him being tied to a tree outside With no one to talk to."
Jay,Why didn't you just tell me this in the first place?
Gloria,Like you would be okay with me stealing a dog?
Jay,No.
Gloria,"Exactly. That's why I didn't tell you. Now the dog is happy, Manny can sleep, and we have pickles."
Jay,"Okay, it worked out this time, But don't forget that stealing is against the law. Now, maybe in Colombia..."
Gloria,"Ah, here we go, Because in Colombia we trip over goats and we kill people in the street. Do you know how offensive that is? Like we are Peruvians!"
Claire,"The contest was hard. Reservations. Even though we had sworn off the internet, The rest of the world hadn't."
Claire,Orlando. Domestic. Representative. Representative! Representative!
Phil,"Really, Claire?"
Claire,You don't understand. I was trying to deal with our plane tickets to visit your family.
Haley,"Please stop. You're just embarrassing yourself. Well, it looks like it's just you and me, old man."
Phil,Bring it.
Mitchell,Thank you.
Cameron,"Yes, thank you. This place is amazing!"
Mitchell,I told you.
Cameron,It's like Hogwarts!
Mitchell,The ladybug sanctuary.
Cameron,"Oh, my gosh. The little cobblestones."
Mitchell,So sweet. I know.
Cameron,Screw the duckies. We belong here. Do you think they're gonna let us in?
Mitchell,"Cam, relax. We're queer, we're here."
Cameron,"Yes, we are."
Cameron,Thank you.
Mitchell,"Yes, thank you."
Mitchell,"Single white mother, black child."
Cameron,"So what? Lily's Asian. We're gay. In the school admissions poker game, we're the winning hand."
Cameron,Disabled interracial lesbians with an African kicker.
Mitchell,Did not see that coming.
Phil,"It's been a while since I read an actual newspaper. Missed that sound. No, no, no, no!"
Claire,What is it?
Phil,Brady's injured. No! He's my whole team. I have to change my roster.
Claire,"Honey, if you can't do it over the phone, You can't do it, because we're not buying Haley a car."
Phil,"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well... Well, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom."
Claire,"Phil Dunphy, don't you even dream of it."
Phil,"Claire, all my friends are in that league. I'm gonna look like an idiot."
Claire,So what?
Phil,So I paid a huge entrance fee.
Claire,How huge?
Phil,"Not huge. Tiny. Oh, my goodness. How is she not cracking up there? Listen to her."
Haley,"No, I know, but do you know?"
Claire,Wait a minute. She's alone.
Phil,So?
Claire,She's alone.
Phil,"Oh, my god."
Haley,"I know. You should see her pants. I'll text it to you. Oh, wait. Okay. Hold on. I'll send it."
Claire,Ha! Aha!
Phil,Aha! Busted!
Haley,"Sophie, I have to call you back."
Phil,I knew it. I knew you couldn't do it. I told you I'd outlast them.
Haley,This sucks!
Alex,What's going on?
Phil,"I'll tell you what's going on. I win. Nobody gets a car, I dump Tom Brady, and our long Amish nightmare is over."
Claire,I can't believe you thought You were gonna put one over on us.
Haley,I can't believe That he's actually already on the internet.
Phil,"Believe it, girl."
Haley,"So, you're actually online right now?"
Phil,Yep.
Haley,"Well, then I hate to break it to you, daddy, but you lose."
Phil,What?
Claire,What?
Haley,This isn't my phone. I carved it out of a bar of soap and colored it in with a marker.
Claire,"Phil, she carved a telephone out of a bar of soap."
Haley,I can't believe it! I'm getting a car!
Phil,"Holy crap, we've been Shawshanked."
Cameron,Wow.
Mitchell,"Uh, well, I'm a lawyer."
Mitchell,Of course.
Mitchell,"Um, well, I..."
Cameron,"While my white-man name is Tucker, I am 1/16 Cherokee. Ready for child to soar like eagle."
Mitchell,"Oh, god."
Haley,"So, what are you saying?"
Claire,You're not getting a car.
Haley,But I won.
Phil,"Yes, but we never thought you would."
Haley,So?
Claire,"So, congratulations on your victory. Nobody can ever take that away from you."
Phil,So true.
Haley,But I spent two days in my room talking to a bar of soap. It's not fair.
Phil,It's totally not fair.
Claire,We're outraged.
Phil,Bad parenting.
Haley,But we had a deal.
Phil,"Which, in hindsight, was utter nonsense."
Claire,Hey.
Mitchell,We hated Billingsley.
Cameron,The place is so stupid.
Claire,"Ugh! You blew the interview, didn't you?"
Mitchell,Lesbians.
Cameron,In a wheelchair.
Claire,Oh.
Jay,You still mad at me?
Gloria,You tell me. What is this?
Jay,"I've been thinking if you said as much about America as I said about Colombia, I'd be plenty ticked off. Doesn't make up for everything, but..."
Gloria,A trip to Colombia?
Jay,"I want to see your village, learn your culture. I love you. I'm sure I'm gonna love where you come from."
Gloria,"Aw, Jay. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
Gloria,No way he's going to my village. I was in a car accidents when I was living there. Both times I hit a goat. One was hurt pretty bad. But it was a good thing I had a shovel in the trunk.
Cameron,"That, though I layretold with fire-haired man, The giving hawk would bring us baby with her skin the color of sweet corn, which my people call maize."
Mitchell,Please stop.
Cameron,"Knowledge is her sustenance, like so much maize... which, you'll remember, means ""corn."
Mitchell,What if I was a single dad?
Claire,"Hi, honey. Breakfast will be ready in a minute."
Luke,Hi.
Claire,Aaaaaaaaah! My ha-a-a-nd! Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Luke,"Very funny, mom. I know it's Halloween. Nice fake hand."
Phil,Aaaah! Aaaah!
Luke,Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
Phil,Ha ha ha!
Claire,Ha ha!
Phil,We love Halloween. Especially Claire.
Claire,"It's my favorite holiday. Ever since I was a kid, I loved scary things. If there was a new horror movie in town, I was the first in line. ""one, please."" Then I met Phil."
Phil,"""two, please."""
Mitchell,Okay. All right. Do me.
Cameron,"♪ do me, do me, do me ♪"
Mitchell,"Cam, I have to say, I feel kind of sexy. Well, squeaky sexy, but..."
Cameron,You know I'd be enjoying this more If Halloween wasn't such a tough day for me. But I want you to go to work... and knock their socks off.
Mitchell,"Well, my last job was at a pretty conservative law firm. No one there would ever dress up for Halloween. But apparently at this new company..."
Mitchell,"Wait, wait, wait. I-I'm sorry. Wait. So people really come to work in costumes here?"
Mitchell,Ohh.
Mitchell,"I'm already the new guy. I don't want to be the non- partipation guy, too."
Cameron,"Not on my watch. Unfortunately, Halloween was marred for me personally by an incident long ago. Now it's just a day I have to get through."
Mitchell,So you've said.
Claire,"All right, so, everybody has to be here at 5:30 to rehearse our house of horrors. You guys have your costumes ready?"
Luke,"Yeah, but it's a secret. Me and Manny came up with something together."
Claire,I love that!
Luke,Can I have some candy?
Claire,"No. How 'bout you, Alex?"
Alex,"Well, I haven't really thought about it. I've got, like, three huge exams tomorrow."
Claire,"Honey, you can't just slap something together at the last minute. You know, if you gave this costume half as much time and attention as you give your homework, you wouldn't be in this situation."
Alex,"Can I remind you, you have one child who's not mediocre?"
Haley,Check it. I'm a scary black cat.
Claire,The only person that costume scares is me. Go change it.
Haley,To what?
Claire,"I don't know. One of your old costumes. Honey, trust me. I am sparing you an entire day of guys asking you if you have a rough tongue. Ew."
Jay,Hello.
Claire,Hi. Dad. It's me. I wanted to make sure you and Gloria were ready for tonight.
Jay,What's tonight?
Claire,"What do you mean, what is tonight? Dad, it's Halloween. You know this."
Jay,"Calm down, Morticia, I'm just teasing you. We'll be there."
Claire,"Yeah, but in costume this time. You can't just show up with a backwards baseball cap and call yourself Snoop Dogg like you did last year."
Jay,"I didn't even know who that guy was. Haley turned my hat around and told me to say it. I thought he was a dog detective. Listen, don't worry. We got the whole thing worked out. Bye-bye."
Gloria,"Hola, Jay!"
Jay,Where are you?
Gloria,"I have Manny in the carpool, And we're going to the dropout."
Jay,"Dropout? You mean that Eddie kid? Yeah, he's a moron."
Gloria,"No, the dropout, where you drop the kids in the school."
Manny,"She means ""drop-off."""
Gloria,That's what I said.
Jay,"Listen, did you ever do anything about costumes for Claire's thing tonight? I'm going to pick them up this afternoon."
Gloria,"You're going to be a ""gargle,"" And I'm gonna be an evil village bruja."
Jay,I know less now than I did before I asked.
Gloria,"Hmm. A bruja is a witch, and a gargle is a gargle."
Manny,"She means ""gargoyle."""
Gloria,That's what I said.
Jay,"As long as you got it covered. Because if Claire doesn't get her Halloween, She turns into a real ""rhymes with 'bruja.'"""
Mitchell,"Oh, no. No, no, no. I'm the only one. Ohh."
Mitchell,"Ohh. Oh, no."
Cameron,Hello?
Mitchell,"There are exactly three people in costume here... A tool, a douche, and me. And I don't have time to go home and change and..."
Cameron,Calm down. Did you bring in the dry-cleaning from last night?
Mitchell,Are you really getting on me about the dry-cleaning wh... Oh. I have suits in the trunk.
Cameron,Look at that. Yesterday's lazy cures today'crazy.
Mitchell,Yes. Thank you! Thank you. Okay.
Mitchell,"Hey, Charlie."
Mitchell,"O-kay. Okay, hey."
Mitchell,Yeah?
Mitchell,"Eh, yeah."
Phil,"Why won't this... hey, Jerry."
Phil,"Thanks. Wait till you see what we got planned for tonight. Claire and I are going as corpse bride and groom. As if there's any other kind, am I right? I'm saying marriage kills you."
Phil,"Oh, my god. I am so sorry."
Phil,"When someone your age dies, What's the first thing you want to know? ""died of what?"" right? You want to hear it was something That could never happen to you. Well, it's the same with divorce. Tell me it was booze, cheating, physical abuse. No problem. I'm a monogamous social drinker, And Claire only sleep- hits me. Just don't tell me it came from out of the blue."
Phil,"Well, that's - that's coconuts. You're super delightful."
Phil,Claire can do it. It's uncan...
Phil,"Okay, but, hey... Jerry, if you need anything, all right? I'm your rock."
Phil,You are not gonna believe this. Judy just left Jerry.
Claire,"Oh, yeah. She was so unhappy. How's he doing?"
Phil,He's not taking it as well as you are.
Claire,"Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I don't mean to be insensitive. I've just got a lot to get done."
Phil,I don't find you insensitive. I find you delightful. Do you find me delightful?
Claire,"Oh, god, I just remembered! Jerry's supposed to be our porch scarecrow. Can you ask him if he'll still do it?"
Phil,He's kind of a mess right now.
Claire,"Yeah, but it might make him feel better be around people."
Phil,"I'll try... But his whole world just turned upside down. Can you imagine? One minute, you're happily married, the next minute, you're completely by yourself."
Mitchell,"I-I-I may have. I may have done that, sir."
Mitchell,"Every time I tried to get out of that costume, I got dragged into another meeting. It was the worst Halloween ever."
Cameron,"Really, Mitchell? The worst Halloween ever? You had squeaky thighs. I lost a childhood."
Gloria,Jay! This came for you.
Jay,"Oh. Hi, honey. What is it?"
Gloria,"I called your secretary and told her to order you some crackers and those cheeses that you like... the tiny, little ones."
Jay,"Thanks. Did you pick up my ""gargle"" costume, too?"
Gloria,Are you making fun of me?
Jay,No.
Gloria,"First, Manny correcting me. And now you? If I have a problem, I want to know, Jay."
Jay,"Honey, look, English is your second language. You're doing great."
Gloria,"Yeah, you're not helping by protecting my feelings. I want you to be honest with me."
Jay,"Okay, well, I may have noticed some tiny, little mistakes You might want to te a look at."
Gloria,Like what?
Jay,"Just little mispronunciations. Like, for example... Last night, you said, ""we live in a doggy-dog world."""
Gloria,So?
Jay,"Well, it's ""dog-eat-dog world."""
Gloria,"Yeah, but... That doesn't make any sense. Who wants to live in a world where dogs eat each other? A doggy-dog world is a beautiful world Full of little puppies! What else do I say wrong?"
Jay,"Well, it's not ""blessings in the skies."" It's ""blessings in disguise."""
Gloria,What else?
Jay,"""carpal tunnel syndrome"" Is not ""carpool tunnel syndrome."""
Gloria,And what else?
Jay,"It's not ""volumptuous."""
Gloria,"Okay, enough. I know that I have an accent. But people understand me just fine!"
Jay,What the hell is this?
Gloria,"I told you, Jay, I called your secretary and told her to order you a box of baby cheeses! Oh! So now it's my fault too!"
Phil,Huh.
Phil,"Gosh, I hate to think of you sitting in there alone, Running through all this in your head. What could you have done differently? What could you have done differently?"
Phil,Don't push me away. I'm not Judy.
Phil,"Spontaneous and sexy. I got it. Yep. And remember, I'm here for you, okay? Ohh! Son of a..."
Claire,What the hell is that?!
Haley,What? You told me to put on an old costume.
Claire,Not from when you were 8. Are you trying to get candy or Japanese businessmen? Change it. Go.
Phil,Jerry is a no-go on the crow.
Claire,You've been over there this whole time?
Phil,"Yeah, he was venting. I couldn't break free. God... You are sexy."
Claire,Honey...
Phil,Not so fast. I don't think we're... It's okay.
Claire,I need to get down.
Phil,"Oh, we can get down. We can get way down."
Claire,"Oh, god! Phil!"
Mitchell,"No! No, no, no, no, no! No! Okay. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Focus, Mitchell. Focus. Focus."
Cameron,Hello?
Mitchell,"I'm trapped in a men's room, And all I have on is the spider-man suit."
Cameron,Hot. Who is this?
Mitchell,"Somebody took my shirt, and all the rest Of my clothes are all ""toilety."" I'm screwed."
Cameron,Why don't you just tell Charlie the truth?
Mitchell,"I can't. I already messed up once today. And I can't risk it. I-I have another suit in my trunk, But I can't get to the car without going through the office."
Cameron,You know what's ironic? Who could really help you right now is spider-man.
Mitchell,"He's here. Ugh! Ooh! Okay. Okay. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. no, no, no."
Luke,"Behold, my creation! Monster, do my bidding!"
Manny,"I do as you command, master."
Claire,So cute.
Haley,Okay. Mom. You cannot have a problem with this. I'm Mother Teresa.
Claire,Are you kidding me?
Haley,What? I'm her back when she was hot.
Claire,I will pay you $10 to go put on more clothes.
Alex,"Bet it's the first time you ever heard that one. Claire ! Okay. You know what? Here. Here we go. Here you go. Let's just cover you up. All right, now, I just want to run through this Really quick with everybody. Um, first, it's ""trick or treat?"" And then, Phil..."
Phil,"""come in if you dare."""
Claire,"Right, and then dad does The thunder and the lightning and the fog. Usher the children in past Alex her cage."
Alex,I'm in a cage?
Claire,Yes! You're in a house of horrors being held against your will.
Alex,"I know, so why do we need the cage?"
Claire,"And then Gloria pops up as the evil village bruja, and she says... ""welcome to your nightmare. Ah ha ha ha ha!"" and the Cam and Haley do their thing. Kids get their candy. They are ushered out. They think it's all over, but it's not! Because out on the porch, the scarecrow pops to life... Wow! ... for one final ""aah!"" And that's... Mitchell, you're the scarecrow!"
Mitchell,"Oh, no, no. I was in a costume all day. It was awful."
Cameron,It's nothing compared to when I was...
Mitchell,You don't own bad Halloweens.
Cameron,Don't I?
Claire,"Okay. We get it, Cam. Hard day. Mitchell, please. The costume's in the kitchen. Come on."
Mitchell,"Ohh. uh, Claire, Claire."
Phil,"Before you go, I just want you to know..."
Claire,Okay. The wig. That - that's...
Phil,...I love you more now than I ev...
Claire,That's nice.
Phil,You're my best friend!
Jay,"Hey, guys."
Phil,"Hey. Wow. God, you guys look great."
Gloria,"Thank you, Phil. I try my best. You look very dead-like."
Jay,"Gloria, stop it. I said I was sorry."
Gloria,"Oh, no, no, Jay. For now on, I only speak in proper American So I don't embarrass you."
Phil,Did she just get back from the dentist?
Jay,She's mad at me because I told her Sometimes people can't understand her.
Phil,"Make it right, Jay. We're all just hanging by a thread."
Claire,"Hey! Dad! Oh, you look great! Oh, good. Okay, Gloria's in position. Hi, Gloria. There you go. Right back here."
Cameron,"Claire, I don't know that I'm... I'm feeling up to this."
Claire,"Why, Cam? Why? What happened that is so awful you simultaneously can't speak of it and yet can't stop talking about it?"
Cameron,I can't. It's too emotional.
Claire,Okay. Some other time.
Cameron,I was 10.
Mitchell,"Oh, god."
Cameron,"Dressed as Quasimodo on a front porch With my best friend, Timmy Reglar, a ghostbuster. There was a bucket of candy with a sign. It said ""take one."" one. Timmy took the entire bucket and put it in his bag. Timmy didn't play by the rules. It's what I liked and feared about him."
Claire,Oh.
Cameron,"Then the bag broke as a crowd of kids rounded the corner, saw the pile of candy. Timmy said, ""Cam did it!"""
Phil,Yes. Yes.
Claire,Okay.
Phil,Come in...If you dare.
Claire,Dad.
Jay,Huh? Oh. L-let me see.
Phil,Thank you for joining us on our sp...
Claire,"No, no, no. First the thunder and the lightning!"
Jay,"Yeah, right. I got it."
Claire,Perfect.
Phil,Thank you for joining us... on our special night.
Claire,Other children haven't fared so well.
Gloria,Welcome to your nightmare. Ha ha ha ha!
Claire,What the hell is that?
Haley,"Okay. But with all the fog, you may not be able to see... ""ahead."""
Cameron,Boo. Timmy started running. I wanted to run too but got stuck on a rose bush and that's when I fell. I fell hard!
Claire,"Okay... Here, here! Have some candy. Happy Halloween. Okay, that was bad. That was a bad start. First of all, Dad, thunder, lightning, fog, cue. And we skipped Alex altogether. And... Gloria, since when do you speak English?"
Gloria,"Oh... so now you have a problem with the way I speak. Like father, like daughter, in this ""dog eat dog"" family..."
Claire,Oh...
Claire,"Okay. Places, places! Good. Phil ; I love you so much!"
Claire,Not now. Not now.
Phil,"Come in, if you dare!"
Claire,Dad! Dad!
Jay,"Oh right! Right! Fog, the cue?"
Phil,Thank you for joining us on our special night.
Claire,Other children haven't fared so well...
Alex,"Ow, help me, help me..."
Gloria,"Welcome to your nightmare, oh, oh, oh!"
Haley,"But with all the fog, you may not be able to see... ""ahead."""
Cameron,"And everyone was screaming! ""that's him! Get quasimodo!"" And then the townspeople started chasing me! And that's when I wet my pants! I wet my pants! I wet my pants."
Phil,Mother of god. Ohh! Son of a...
Claire,"What is wrong with everyone?! Cam, ""townspeople""? Really?"
Cameron,I lived on a farm. They lived in town. They were the townspeople.
Claire,"And, dad! Dad! It goes - lightning, thunder, fog cue!"
Jay,This whole thing is a colossal fog cue.
Gloria,"Claire just doesn't understand, Cam. Maybe she's never been picked on for being different."
Claire,"When, Gloria? When have you ever been picked on for ""being different""?"
Gloria,"Ask the ""gargle."""
Claire,what did she say?
Jay,Gloria!
Luke,I think she went insane.
Manny,She's not insane. She's my mother.
Luke,I'm your mother now!
Jay,"Gloria... I want to tell you a story... about a guy eating in a diner, alone. Behind him he hears a woman talking. He doesn't turn around - 5 minutes, 10 minutes. Just listening to the woman, the life in her voice. And before he even sees her he realizes he's fallen in love. Now, I'll give you a guess who that guy is."
Mitchell,"Aw, my dad was..."
Gloria,Aah!
Mitchell,"Ohh! Oh, my god!"
Cameron,You know what? I'm just gonna go.
Claire,"No. Come on, Cam."
Alex,"Uh, if uncle cam is leaving, I'm just gonna go upstairs and study."
Haley,"Yeah, I have a party to go to, so..."
Mitchell,Ohh! She punched me in the face!
Gloria,"He came out of nowhere, and he scared the baby ""cheeses"" out of me!"
Jay,"Hey, you're talking normal again."
Gloria,"Oh, I loved the story about the old man."
Jay,"Well, nobody said ""old."""
Mitchell,"Oh, Cam, can we please just go?"
Cameron,Yes.
Claire,"Yeah, go, please. I don't care."
Mitchell,Oh. Claire.
Claire,"No, no. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not done. So not done. Look, here's the thing. We - we have reworks at Christmas now because that's what they do in Colombia, and I don't mind. Thanksgiving - that used to be me roasting a turkey, Until the gays took it over with whatever new turkey-cooking craze it is that you saw on the food network, All I ask - all I ask is that you leave me Halloween. Yeah, Halloween. I realize it is a crazy-ass holiday for a grown woman to care about this much, But it is my crazy-ass holiday. Mine."
Cameron,That's a lot of complaining from somebody Who asked for thirds of our tandoori turkey last year.
Phil,Claire.
Claire,No! No! Not ready to talk!
Phil,"No. Listen... I know I haven't been much help today. That - that whole Jerry and Judy thing, It really hit me hard."
Claire,Is that why you've been acting like such a nut all day?
Phil,"You know, what if someday that's us?"
Claire,"Honey! Okay, you... you might not want to hear this right now after the meltdown I just had in there, but... you're kind of stuck with me."
Phil,You promise?
Claire,Aw. I do.
Phil,Oh. That's great.
Claire,"We should just put out a bowl of candy and have a cocktail, right?"
Phil,Yeah.
Manny,Come in if you dare.
Luke,Thank you for joining us on our special night.
Haley,Other children haven't fared so well.
Phil,Hey!
Alex,Help me! Help me!
Claire,She's doing it.
Gloria,"welcome to your nightmare, muchachos!"
Phil,No! No!
Haley,"But with all this fog, it might be hard to see ""ahead."""
Cameron,Aaaaahhh!
Claire,Yeah! Yeah!
Mitchell,: Wha-ha-ha!
Phil,We're back in the game! Let's go!
Claire,I love it! I love it!
Phil,"whoa! That was for you. That was for you. I just did it for you. No, it wasn't."
Luke,"Or I'll have to give you the 'hindenburg' maneuver."","
Cameron,"Oh, one time she caught me staring off. And she goes, ""Cam, what's wrong? You look like a deer in 'head lice'!"""
Jay,"In the service, I had a job, briefly, handling explosives. which sounds dangerous, but it's not. You store them at the right temperature, you have no problems..."
Phil,"If you tell her she doesn't have a choice, she'll say, ""don't you give me an 'old tomato.'"""
Mitchell,Or when she says...
Gloria,okay! Enough! You try speaking in another language! Everybody out of my house!
Jay,...Until you do.
Claire,What are you doing?
Phil,Shh. One of the smoke alarms is chirping. I'm trying to figure out which one it is so I can change the battery.
Claire,"Well, if anybody can find it it's you."
Phil,You s-sound horrible. Why don't... Why don't you go back to bed?
Claire,"'cause I've got too much to do. I've got to make the ladyfingers for the bake sale, and I've got to go by the gym... I left my phone there yesterday."
Phil,"I'll do all that. We're a team. When one of us is weak, we lean on the other."
Claire,"Honey, you don't have to do that stuff."
Phil,"Honey, with all you do for me, including going to the gym four times a week to keep me interested, I got this."
Claire,Don't you have houses to show today?
Phil,They...Canceled.
Claire,"Ohh, pumpkin."
Phil,Are you kidding me? It's...lucky. This way I get to stay here and take care of you.
Claire,Okay.
Phil,Hey!
Phil,She's on her way down. Don't get too close to my wife.
Claire,"Oh, god."
Phil,"Okay, that came from the kitchen."
Phil,"Really? Okay, you wait in here and listen for it. I'm gonna wait in there."
Claire,"I'm coming with you. Boy, I wish Haley would date some other boys."
Phil,"What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?"
Claire,"Don't. I just feel like she owes it to herself to see what else is out there. The way that Dylan's always hanging around here, he's probably gonna try to marry her the second she turns 18."
Phil,"Hey, you never know. Maybe those two were meant to be together... Like we were."
Claire,"Honey, Haley and Dylan are not us."
Cameron,"No, I think that amount will be fine. I'm just happy you want Lily. I-I think you're gonna be very happy with her. Okay. Oh!"
Mitchell,Cam? Did you just sell our baby?
Cameron,"No, but do you remember that agent we met that represents child actors, the one who said Lily might have what it takes and gave us his card?"
Mitchell,"Yeah, that I threw away."
Cameron,"That I fished out of the trash? That was him they're shooting a children's-furniture-store commercial today, And they want Lily!"
Mitchell,"Look, I threw away that card for a reason."
Cameron,"Come on, it'll be fun, And Lily will be on TV, and we can put the money in her college account."
Mitchell,"No let's just let our daughter have a normal childhood, huh?"
Cameron,I think that gay cruise has sailed. It's just one commercial.
Mitchell,I don't like it. No. No.
Cameron,"Oh, what, so that's it? You're the parent with the final say? Why is that? Because you make the money?"
Mitchell,"It's not about that, and you know it."
Cameron,I wouldn't expect you to understand us. You're not theater folk.
Mitchell,"Neither are you. You did ""godspell"" one summer in a barn. You're barn folk."
Cameron,"Get used to that jealousy, Lily. Ordinary people just don't understand us."
Gloria,"Hola, Jack."
Gloria,"Manny had a doctor's appointment, So we're gonna catch lunch with Jay... is he there?"
Gloria,Okay.
Manny,"Good day, Jackson."
Manny,I see you're still forklifting.
Manny,"Man, I was gonna say that joke!"
Jay,"I'm sorry, but I gotta have lunch with my wife today. I know, baby, but I had to marry her so she could stay in the country."
Gloria,"Oh, no! Where am I gonna find another husband that wears sweatpants to work?"
Jay,Resort wear.
Gloria,Mm-hmm. Maybe last resort.
Jay,"Listen, I'm glad you guys stopped by for lunch, 'cause you know what? I got to work a little late tonight."
Gloria,"No, not tonight. Did you forget our date?"
Jay,No! No. I was kidding!
Jay,"I had no idea what she was talking about. Gloria -god love her... Likes to celebrate every possible milestone in our relationship... Day we met... Our first date... which I forgot, so we got in a big fight. Now we commemorate the big fight."
Gloria,I thought we could re-create the day. Do everything that we did the first time. So romantic.
Jay,"You know, that's exactly what I was thinking."
Gloria,Ay. Jack is so nice. I think he really likes Manny.
Jay,"What he likes is getting out of work. Wait a minute, is that Manny driving?"
Gloria,Is it? Aah!
Jay,"Yeah, it's him."
Gloria,"Ay, my poor papi. Two doctors in one day."
Manny,"Mom, I'm fine. The hospital said I could go back to school."
Gloria,"No, you suffered a traumatic experience."
Manny,I barely remember it! I remember crashing through the wall and the ambulance ride to the hospital.
Jay,That wasn't an ambulance. I drove you.
Manny,Then what was that siren?
Jay,That was your mother.
Gloria,I was not that loud.
Jay,"Cars pulled over, honey."
Manny,"Jay, I'm sorry about your wall."
Jay,Wasn't your fault.. And I've already taken care of him.
Gloria,You killed him?
Jay,You can't kill people here. I fired him.
Manny,But it was just an accident! He didn't mean it!
Jay,The guy's a screw-up. Should have been gone months ago.
Manny,Can't we just give him another chance?
Jay,"What is this ""we""? Let me explain something to you people. Here in this family, it's we. At work, it's me. My rules, my decisions... Period."
Gloria,That's not fair!
Jay,"You mad at me, too?"
Gloria,"No. You're right. It's your work. Besides, I can't be mad at you... not on our special day."
Jay,"Honey, I was thinking... With what happened to Manny, maybe we better postpone our special day until next weekend."
Gloria,No. Next weekend is the anniversary Of the first time that I cooked for you.
Phil,"How you doin', typhoid Clairey?"
Claire,Hey. what are you doing home?
Phil,She caught your cold and had to come home. I thought we should contain you two and keep it from spreading through the house.
Claire,Come here. I'm so sorry.
Haley,Aw. it's okay.
Claire,"Hey, did you finish my ladyfingers?"
Phil,Not yet.
Claire,Did you pick up my phone from the gym?
Phil,Not yet.
Claire,Is that the smoke detector? I thought you fixed that.
Phil,"Boy, you're really starting to sound like your old self."
Claire,You know what this reminds me of?
Haley,Huh?
Claire,When you were little and we used to snuggle and watch soap operas together. Remember that? Nothing's changed. Sonya's still married to that guy.
Haley,One second.
Claire,The one with the... bad hairline.
Haley,Dylan?
Claire,O...Kay.
Haley,"God, I miss you, too. oh, it's just a cold, silly. You don't have to conceive of a world without me. Oh, nothing. I'm just in bed with my mom. Stop freaking out. It is not coming true."
Phil,"Uh, Mrs. Vaughn? It's Phil Dunphy. It's about 3:30. Now, I know you said you'd moved on, but, um, there's been a significant price reduction in the, uh, house in Sullivan Canyon, which I know you loved. So, uh, if there's any chance you might reconsider, I know you will not be sorry. I can meet you anytime, so just give me a call. Any... anytime. I can meet you wherever that... place is that you feel, uh, that would be best. Okay, thank you. Bye."
Luke,Dad?
Phil,"Hey, buddy! How are ya? W-what are you doin'?"
Luke,Keeping the germs off me.
Phil,You care about germs? I've seen you kiss a pigeon on the mouth.
Luke,My class is going to Disneyland in two days. I can't get mom's cold.
Phil,Oh. Good plan. I remember this. My dad bought it during the Cuban missile crisis. I never got a turn in that. You think maybe later I could...
Luke,"Yeah, maybe. What are you doing home in the afternoon?"
Phil,"Oh, no big deal. Just had a couple of showings fall through."
Luke,Again?
Phil,You know what I always say.
Luke,Sure do. Can't get back on that horse unless you fall off.
Phil,That's right.
Luke,Ow. That's loud.
Phil,Sorry. Where is that coming from?
Phil,"Changing the battery in a smoke detector is what they teach you in man 101, So, of course, every time I hear that noise, all I hear is, ""beep beep... you're not a man. Beep beep... you're not..."" Really?!"
Luke,"Hey, dad. Can you open this for me?"
Phil,"Oh. Sure, buddy. Ow! Mm!"
Luke,What happened?
Phil,I broke a nail.
Jay,Mitchell! What's up?
Mitchell,What do you... what do you mean? You... you just sent me an urgent text saying to come right over.
Manny,I used Jay's phone.
Mitchell,"Oh, what happened to your face?"
Manny,"Oh, just a little scrape-up. Mitchell, I'd like to engage your legal services in representing my friend Jack in a wrongful- termination suit."
Jay,"Forget it. He's not coming back. Don't take the case, Mitchell."
Mitchell,I-I don't think I was gonna take the case.
Manny,"Fine. Then, under the circumstances, we have nothing further to talk about. These will be my last words to you."
Jay,Knock knock.
Manny,"Who's there? Okay, you got me. I hope you feel clever tricking your kid."
Gloria,"Hello, Mitch!"
Mitchell,"Hi, Gloria."
Gloria,Congratulations!
Mitchell,Hmm? On what?
Gloria,Lily's commercial.
Mitchell,"Oh, no, no. We turned that down."
Gloria,Are you sure? Because Cam sent me a picture of her in her makeup chair.
Mitchell,"Uh, sorry. He what?"
Gloria,"Oh, it's so exciting. You have to remember this day so that you can celebrate it every year."
Cameron,"Yes, uh, she sure is. Did you hear that, Lily? You're the talent. Isn't that magical? Ooh. Grapes. Mm! And that is a prop."
Haley,"Okay, we're really gonna hang up this time. On the count of three. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Hello? I can't believe he hung up! I'm calling him back."
Claire,"Hey, give me that."
Haley,"Oh, my god, is that Jesse?"
Claire,"Mm-hmm. And he's still married to Angie. You know something else you might find interesting? Sonya is drinking, because she married a buffoon when she was young, and now she realizes she's wasted her entire life. Can you imagine making a mistake like that?"
Haley,"Yeah, that must be...Horrible."
Claire,"Yeah, now she's just a bitter ghost of a woman, filled with resentment. But that's what happens when you commit to someone before you see what else is out there."
Phil,Seriously?!
Haley,"She couldn't have laid it on thicker. ""ghost of a woman""? ""total buffoon""? I'm not an idiot. She was talking about her and my dad!"
Haley,"Yeah, well, maybe Sonya and her husband just need to... work a little harder."
Claire,"Can he give her those years back? I mean, she could have been something. She could have traveled the world. Been with fascinating men. She could have accomplished things. That's all she thinks about now... Every time she looks at him."
Phil,Aah! Ow!
Luke,Is that mom's apron?
Phil,It's an apron. It's unisex. Some of the world's greatest chefs are men.
Luke,But it's bumped out where the boobs go. That's happening more and more.
Phil,"Hadn't noticed. Mrs. Vaughn! Thanks for calling back. Yeah, I was just about to... I see. Uh, is there anything I can say that will... All right. Well, thank you very much. And if... o-okay. Goodbye."
Luke,Did you lose another one?
Phil,"Hey. Can't lose something you never had, right, pal?"
Luke,"That was the doorbell, dad."
Phil,"Yeah, I know."
Luke,"So, what happens if people stop buying houses? Are we all gonna have to get jobs?"
Phil,"Just a little slump, buddy. Nothing I can't handle."
Phil,Oh! Yeah. Come on in.
Phil,"Great. Thanks. I'm Phil, Claire's husband."
Phil,"You too. Oh, sorry! I burnt my ladyfingers."
Gloria,"So quiet. It's like Christian ""silence"" reading room."
Manny,I'm fine.
Jay,So am I.
Gloria,"Okay, my two stubborn burros. I'm going out. Manny, be a good boy. Jay... Mm, I'll see you later. I think you know where."
Jay,"Honey? You know what I was just thinking? You know how when people are in love,s they finish each other's sentences? Like, um... Tonight we're going to..."
Gloria,Have fun!
Jay,Yes. When we get to...
Gloria,...Gether later!
Manny,"You have no idea where you're going, do you?"
Jay,Tell me.
Manny,Hire Jack back.
Jay,Forget it.
Manny,Your funeral.
Cameron,"Okay, Lily, daddy's gonna be right over here. Okay. Oh, and, um, by the way, if it helps, I have a list of things Lily can do. She can blow a kiss, uh, flap her arms like a bird..."
Cameron,Okay. Thank you.
Mitchell,Cam. Cam.
Cameron,How did you get on the set?
Mitchell,I walked on it. It's not MGM. It's a warehouse behind a mattress store. I can't believe you went behind my back. We agreed...
Cameron,"We didn't agree on anything. You agreed. We don't have to agree on everything. I didn't like the book you bought her last week, but I didn't stop you from reading it to her."
Mitchell,"Well, what was wrong with it?"
Cameron,"How was it a big day for Biscuit, Mitchell? How?"
Mitchell,"Okay, this isn't about Biscuit."
Cameron,"I know. It's about our daughter, Lily."
Mitchell,"No, you want to know the truth? I think it's about you, Cam. I think you're using our daughter to fulfill some childhood dream of yours."
Cameron,"Oh. That's great. There are a lot of important people here, so I'm not gonna get mad, but I resent the implication that I would do anything that's not in the best interest of our daughter."
Cameron,You can apologize to me anytime you're ready.
Mitchell,Are you kidding me?
Cameron,What?
Mitchell,This commercial... it's a big stereotype.
Cameron,"It's called ""ironic."""
Mitchell,"No, this is why Lily was perfect... she's Asian. She's a prop."
Cameron,"It's called ""niche casting."""
Mitchell,"Stop telling me what stuff is called! You're so blinded by the spotlight, you can't see what's really going on here!"
Cameron,Excuse me. 'scuse me. 'scuse me! 'scuse me! 'scuse me!
Cameron,"Well, don't you think this commercial just might be the teeniest bit racist? I mean, um, save-zilla?"
Cameron,"No, I know, but maybe... Maybe we could just tone it down a bit. Maybe not hit the accents so hard?"
Cameron,"Yeah, well, I know. I just... I can't let my daughter do this."
Cameron,"Well, I also have the best attorney in town, So do your worst. And by the way, Lily is Vietnamese, not Japanese. There's a big difference, but you wouldn't know that, because you're only interested in seeing these children as interchangeable stereotypes, not human beings. Come on, Lily. Let's go."
Mitchell,"Cam? Cam, that's not..."
Cameron,"Hi, buddy. There we go."
Jay,"Going to meet your mother. Figured it out all by myself. Two years ago, we got our marriage license, we went to a little hot dog stand she said was the most romantic meal she ever had in her life. That's it, isn't it? Yeah, that's it. You can give me the cold shoulder the rest of your life. Jack's not coming back. See, I could overlook the goofing off, but you could have been seriously hurt today. Anybody puts my kid in danger doesn't get a second chance ever. I'll see you later."
Manny,Did you just call me your kid?
Jay,"Oh, geez."
Manny,You've never said that before.
Jay,Sure I have.
Manny,Unh-unh.
Jay,"Well, of course you're my kid. I mean, what do you think?"
Manny,You're going to the wrong place.
Jay,What?
Manny,It's not your wedding license.
Jay,What is it?
Manny,First kiss.
Jay,No. Just tell me.
Manny,"I mean, your first kiss... with my mom."
Jay,"My god, you're right. Thanks!"
Manny,The pier.
Jay,Thanks.
Haley,"But maybe Sonya didn't make a mistake, maybe she just met her soul mate when she was young."
Claire,"No, no, no. That never happens. See, she threw her life away, and now she wants out."
Haley,"Okay, let's cut the crap. We're not talking about some character on a soap opera here, are we?"
Claire,"No. No, we're not. Honey, I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but... ...I've been feeling that way for a really long time, And...Can we be honest with each other? He's kind of a doofus."
Haley,"I guess, but... I thought you liked that about him."
Claire,"Mm, mnh-mnh. No, I never did. Believe me, honey. There are many better options out there."
Haley,Like who?
Claire,"I don't know. Off the top of my head, uh... How about that cute guy who delivers the pizzas?"
Haley,He's like 18!
Claire,So?
Phil,"Don't mind me, ladies. This is the last one. I've changed the batteries in every last smoke detector in the house."
Luke,"Hey, dad. I think I found a place online where I can sell this organ. Can you drive me to the black market?"
Phil,"I think they mean a different kind of organ, buddy."
Claire,"Sweetie, why are you trying to sell that?"
Luke,In case things with dad's job get even worse.
Phil,"Honestly, I don't know why everybody's making such a big deal. Everything's fine. It makes no sense! I changed every one!"
Claire,I'm gonna call my dad.
Phil,"No, we're not calling anyone! I can handle this. I just need the old burglar basher."
Luke,Is that your college cheerleading baton?
Phil,Not when you're on the business end of it.
Claire,Oh!
Phil,"Guess that one won't be chirping anymore, will it?"
Claire,Honey...
Haley,Go after him.
Claire,"Oh, no, he just needs to blow off some steam."
Phil,How's that for battery?!
Haley,"Mom, like it or not, you made a commitment, and maybe that doesn't mean anything to you anymore, but you owe it to this family to save your marriage and give it one more try."
Claire,What?
Phil,"End of the line, smokey Joe!"
Haley,"Look, dad may be a doofus, But he is 10 times better than any pizza-delivery boy. Go to him."
Claire,Did you...
Phil,I just detected your ass gettin' kicked!
Claire,Okay. Honey...
Phil,"Thought I forgot about you, didn't you? Nope."
Claire,"Phil, no. Stop."
Phil,I gotta stop the damn chirping.
Claire,This isn't about the noise. Sweetie... ...You're having a bad day.
Phil,At the end of a bad month.
Claire,I know.
Phil,"You know how scary that is, Claire?"
Claire,"No. No, I don't, because you never tell me the bad stuff. You only share all the good stuff. Honey, what happened to us being a team? Right? We're supposed to lean on each other. Honey... I have faith in you. Mm."
Phil,I must be catching your cold.
Claire,Mm-hmm. Okay. You know what? Let's just get new smoke detectors.
Phil,"We already changed them out last year. Remember, buddy? You helped me."
Luke,Sure did.
Phil,Wait a minute. What'd you do with the old ones?
Luke,"You told me to throw them in the garbage, So I put them in the attic to make a robot."
Phil,"It's the old ones. The batteries are dying, And we can hear them through the vents. you did it, buddy! I'm sorry."
Claire,I love you.
Phil,I love you.
Haley,I did that.
Claire,Oh. That must be the pizza I ordered.
Haley,Pizza? You ordered pizza?
Claire,"Yeah. I was just sort of in the mood, you know?"
Haley,But we had pizza a couple nights ago.
Claire,"I know, but I had an urge, And when you get an urge, you get an urge."
Haley,"Okay, here, I'll get it!"
Claire,"No, sweetie, I've got it."
Haley,"No, mom. You're always asking me to do things. I'll get it. Here, just sit back, relax."
Claire,I-I...Really...
Haley,"Okay, get the change. I'll get the pizza. Don't worry. Here! And I think it's best you don't come around here anymore!"
Manny,Good afternoon. Thanks for coming. It's so nice to spend my birthday surrounded by so many smiling faces. I was almost too depressed to come today. I realized I let my childhood slip away.
Claire,"Come on, everybody! We're gonna be late for Manny's birthday! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!"
Luke,"I'm ready, mom."
Claire,"You sure, honey?"
Luke,Yep.
Claire,Then take a quick peek at your feet.
Luke,"Oh! Come on, Luke!"
Mitchell,"Are you gonna walk faster, or should I get Lily's stroller out of the car and push you?"
Cameron,"Would you relax? The restaurant's like five minutes away from here... ohh, free lotion."
Mitchell,Stop stopping to smell the roses. Manny's present.
Cameron,"Ohh, you are such a Pritchett."
Mitchell,What's that supposed to mean?
Jay,Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Gloria,I'm looking for the keys!
Jay,Of course you are.
Jay,"I like being on time. It's easy 'cause I'm organized. Not my wife. You'd think growing up in a place full of death squads and drunken uncles, she'd have learned to move a little bit faster."
Gloria,"Ay! Sorry, sorry. I couldn't find my earring. So, what were we talking about, huh?"
Claire,"Honey, come on. We're gonna be late. Let's go."
Phil,"Yeah, yeah, just filling out the application to family camp."
Claire,Ohh.
Phil,"You don't win the ""dirty dancing"" competition and not go back to defend your crown."
Claire,"Hmm. That's right. Come on, honey."
Phil,But shoot for the king... You better kill him.
Phil,"Every summer, we spend a week at family camp. It's just like regular camp, but with the family!"
Claire,"Yeah. I don't think that needed any clarification, Phil."
Phil,Somebody's still a little toy about losing last year's color war.
Claire,Not.
Phil,She was on team blue...
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,Or as I like to refer to them as team blue-zer. And I was on white.
Claire,That's good.
Phil,And if you ain't white...
Claire,No.
Phil,You ain't right!
Claire,Phil! Have you learned nothing?
Phil,My good man.
Claire,"Okay, come on, everybody. Front door! Now!"
Phil,"Claire, relax. It takes 15 minutes to get there."
Claire,It takes 20 minutes.
Phil,If we take your route.
Claire,"Well, my way is the most direct."
Phil,Directly into traffic.
Claire,"Uh, your way is directly into... The suckiest way."
Phil,Want to make this interesting?
Alex,"Yeah, I don't think that's possible."
Phil,We take two cars and see who gets there first.
Claire,Fine. Fine. Let's do that. It's on.
Phil,Yeah! It is on! I'll take the girls.
Claire,"Luke, your dad and I are splitting up."
Luke,Why?
Alex,Another one of their stupid arguments.
Luke,Okay. I'll go with dad.
Claire,"No, no. Buddy. Come with me."
Phil,"Prepare to be... my shoes. Come on, Phil!"
Manny,How do I look?
Jay,Like al Capone.
Manny,Thanks!
Jay,"Happy Birthday, kid."
Manny,Whoa! A bb gun?!
Jay,Enjoy. That's the best gift my dad ever gave me.
Gloria,My keys are nowhere! We're gonna have to go in your car.
Jay,It's in the shop. Where was the last place you put your keys?
Gloria,"Oh, so now it's my fault? Where was the last place you put my keys? Mm-hmm."
Jay,In your hand when I bought you the car.
Manny,"Hey, Jay, on the box, it says ""ages 16 and up."" Is this an appropriate gift for me?"
Jay,"Are you kidding me? You were born 16. You know, we wouldn't be having this problem if you hadn't lost the spare set."
Gloria,I didn't lose them. Somebody came in here and stole them!
Jay,And left the car.
Manny,"What do you mean, I was born 16?"
Jay,"I'm just saying, you were never much of a kid. And that's a good thing, 'cause I never liked kids. You know, you ought to try the fridge. 'Cause that's where we found your cellphone."
Gloria,"It was only one time, Jay. And you know I always eat after I talk to my mother."
Jay,"Happy Birthday, old man."
Manny,"Well, I've forgotten a lot of things in my life. But what Jay said hit me hard. I'd forgotten to have a childhood."
Alex,"Dad, that was a stop sign."
Phil,I'll stop twice on the way back.
Haley,"Oh, good, it'll give us a chance to pick up that hubcap you lost cutting through the temple parking lot. Yellow... yellow! Okay."
Claire,"Are you seeing this? We are making every light, and we don't even have to speed. The system works."
Luke,Mom?
Claire,"I know, I went a little fast back there, but, really, 40 is the same as 35."
Luke,You say that a lot.
Phil,I don't think you two appreciate what's at stake here our lives?
Haley,Our lives ?
Phil,"You know I love your mother, but I think you also know a certain look she gets that says, ""just listen to me, I'm always right."""
Haley,You mean her face?
Phil,"N-now we're getting this. If we're right this one time, then we never have to be right again. When she says, ""that balloon can't carry a person, Phil,"" I say, ""Manny's birthday."""
Alex,"""Take your jacket, Alex. I think it's gonna rain."""
Phil,"""Manny's birthday."""
Haley,Don't look at me. Look at the road.
Phil,"""Manny's birthday."""
Haley,"No, dad! Look at the road! There's a truck!"
Phil,Sweet baby!
Claire,We are so kicking your dad's butt! We are the best ones!
Luke,How come you and dad are breaking up?
Claire,What?
Luke,"If it's just a little disagreement, can't you just work it out?"
Claire,"Oh, sweetie, you thought that when I said we were splitting up... No. No, your dad and I are fine, honey. We just were gonna take separate cars to see who could get to the restaurant faster."
Luke,"Oh, that's a relief."
Claire,"Ohh, you must have been feeling awful back there. I am so sorry."
Luke,It's okay.
Claire,Why did you say you'd go with your dad?
Alex,Great. Mom gets to be right again.
Phil,"Hey, bad attitudes lose races."
Haley,"No, swerving into a curb and popping your tire loses races."
Alex,"We should call the cops and say mom's car was stolen. They arrest her, we win."
Phil,"No, they trace those calls. But this is great. Thinking like a team! Good practice for family camp."
Haley,"We're, uh, we're doing that again?"
Phil,"Oh, yeah! And this year I predict total white domination."
Haley,Can't go back there.
Alex,I heard this summer there's gonna be a hoedown.
Haley,I can't.
Alex,Haley!
Haley,I can't! I can't.
Mitchell,Eight minutes talking to the lady at the stationery store and still no present.
Cameron,"You know, I think a new friend is like a present."
Mitchell,"Yeah, I read that card, too. Can we please just buy the next thing we see and get out of here?"
Cameron,"You know, why can't you enjoy this? It's a beautiful afternoon, Lily's with a sitter. The day is ours!"
Cameron,Helen!!
Mitchell,"Oh, look at that. Another friend. Off we go. Very busy."
Cameron,No. Stop. You are too tied to your rigid schedules. You're missing life. It took all of two seconds to help this nice man.
Cameron,Two seconds. Yeah.
Cameron,He says he's so sorry! And that he's always loved you!
Cameron,Please come up and talk to him! His life would be empty without you! I'm sorry I'm going off script. It just felt right.
Cameron,"No, you know what? Give him your cellphone. I'll chase Helen down and give her my phone. They can hash it out."
Mitchell,Are you... are you serious?
Cameron,"Yes, I'm serious as a heart attack."
Jay,You always do this. Now we're gonna be late to our own party.
Gloria,Stop shouting.
Jay,"Well, technically, I wasn't really..."
Manny,"Uh, yes, hello. Is Seymour butts there? I'd never made a prank call... Never mixed different sodas together to see what they'd taste like. So I knew I had to make the most of what little childhood I had left. Not ""lutts."" I'm looking for butts. Yes, I'm trying to get ahold of butts. Very funny. I don't have time for this foolishness."
Jay,Maybe if you had a system for where you leave things.
Gloria,"I have a system. I put down things, then I remember where I put them."
Jay,"And that would be preferable to, say, putting them on the key holder which just happens to look like a large key."
Gloria,Stop screaming!
Jay,What are you doing?
Manny,Turning back the clock. Disgusting!
Jay,Don't judge me. You've never been married. This never happened.
Manny,I don't know what you're talking about.
Jay,That's a good man.
Manny,Boy. I'm a boy!
Mitchell,You all right? You okay?
Mitchell,"Oh. Okay. Well, I think this is for you."
Cameron,"Just open your heart and listen, Helen."
Mitchell,Yeah. I was here when it happened. Okay. It's all right. We'll just...
Cameron,"Helen, you have to try. I once almost let my own fears stop me from embarking on a relationship, and I would have lost the love of my life."
Mitchell,Cam...
Cameron,"Hang on. Hang on, Helen! I'll have you down in a jiffy! Hold on tight! Ow. Nails. Helen. Nails. Nails. Nails. Helen."
Cameron,Give him a chance!!
Mitchell,"She's right here. Cam, come on. We're running out of time."
Cameron,We're running out of time? Sensitive. Go to him.
Cameron,Without love we're nothing.
Cameron,It was a pleasure meeting you both.
Claire,"I get it, Luke. You think he's the fun one. That's why you'd go with him."
Luke,What?
Claire,You think your dad is more fun than I am.
Luke,Definitely.
Claire,"""Definitely."""
Luke,"Dad's, like, crazy-fun."
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Luke,But you're nice.
Claire,I'm nice?!
Luke,"Well, not now."
Alex,Tell him.
Phil,Tell me what?
Alex,Nothing.
Phil,"Hey, what do we call daddy's car, girls?"
Phil,"The cone of trust. Exactamundo. Where you can speak your mind with no judgment. So, what is it? Boys? Your bodies are changing? Eggs?"
Alex,No! No. We were just thinking that maybe... If... if you're open to it...
Haley,"Dad, we love you, but we do not want to go to family camp this year."
Alex,Dad? Are you upset?
Phil,Nope.
Haley,Then what was that sniff?
Phil,"Sniff? What sniff? I'm... I'm, uh... I'm actually relieved. The day that I've been dreading, uh, the day when you two finally outgrow me, has finally arrived, and I'm handling it really well."
Haley,"Dad, are you crying?"
Phil,Nope.
Alex,Are you sure you're okay?
Phil,Yep.
Alex,"Oh, my God. He is crying. I've never seen dad cry before."
Haley,"But, dad, if you cry, then I'll cry!"
Phil,I'm not crying.
Haley,We made our daddy cry!
Phil,You called me daddy?
Haley,Because you are our daddy!
Phil,I'll always be your daddy!
Luke,"Don't cry, mom."
Claire,"I am not crying. Let me fill you in on a little secret, Luke. When I met your dad, I was fun, too. But I had to give all that up, because you can't have two fun parents. That's a carnival. You know that kid Liam who wears pajama pants to school and pays for things with a $100 bill? Two fun parents. Mark my words. Mm- hmm."
Phil,"Oh, my God! Ohh!"
Luke,"You're fun, too, mom. Uh-huh. I just said I'd go with dad because I think he'd need me more."
Gloria,How come I do all the looking and you do all the sitting?
Jay,'Cause you do all the losing.
Gloria,"Oh, and you're this close of doing all the sleeping in a tent in the backyard!"
Jay,Did you check your purse?
Gloria,"Yes, of course!"
Jay,It's a big purse. You might want to look again.
Gloria,Okay. I check. You rest. No. There's nothing.
Jay,You're sure?
Gloria,Yes. I've looked twice now. There's nothing. Okay.
Jay,Then you better call us a cab! Manny! Manny? What the hell? Where'd that thing come from?
Manny,"Christmas. Two years ago. Never took it out of the box. ""Who would enjoy that?"" I thought. A kid, that's who."
Jay,"Well, come on. We've got your party."
Manny,What's the point? You were right. I-I was born 16. I've lost my childhood.
Gloria,"Why did you want me to look again in my purse, Jay, huh? Is it because you put the keys in there?"
Jay,No. Why did you find it?
Gloria,"Yes, I found them because you put the keys in there! Manny, what the hell are you doing there?"
Jay,He wants to cancel his party because he missed his childhood.
Gloria,"The party that I have rescheduled three times, changed the restaurant twice so that the whole family could be together?!"
Manny,"Please send my regrets. Now, if I could have a little privacy..."
Gloria,Privacy?! Esto es lo que me faltaba a mí. Privacy?! ¿en esta casa?
Jay,Is that a skateboard down there?
Manny,The second thing that slipped right out from under me today.
Jay,"Okay, time to get out."
Manny,The first was my childhood.
Jay,I get it!
Gloria,"I am so sick of stubborn men! You, you act like a little boy that doesn't want to accept that he's wrong. And you like a sad old man that doesn't wt to be happy! That's it!"
Manny,You could have shot me!
Gloria,"Come on, Manny. I could've unbuttoned your shirt if I wanted to. Now come here, or sink! And I'm taking this with me in the car."
Jay,Vámonos.
Cameron,"I know that face, Mitchell."
Mitchell,"Okay, a-and we're walking."
Cameron,It means you were right and I was wrong for trying to help two people.
Mitchell,Adulterers?
Cameron,Fair enough.
Mitchell,"A-actually, the most adult adulterers ever."
Cameron,But my impulse was still right.
Mitchell,"Oh, God. Here we go."
Cameron,"Life is about being... yes. You know what? Here we do go. It's about being spontaneous. It's about throwing yourself into something, not working long hours every night at the office. It's like you're living your l... what is this?"
Mitchell,I don't know.
Cameron,"Excuse me, constable, what... what is going on? Oh, it's a flash mob! It's a flash mob! Ooh! We saw it on YouTube. Remember? People get together and choreograph big dance numbers!"
Mitchell,We should go. T-this is kind of weird.
Cameron,"No, this is joyful, Mitchell. You, of all people, should..."
Mitchell,"Cam's right. I can be a little rigid. So when Chad from accounting, who I always thought was gay but apparently is not, um, told me about this flash mob, I thought, ""Hells yes."" Uh, we've been practicing after work a couple of nights a week. And it's... it's been a big commitment, but it's totally worth it. This dance is my love letter to Cam."
Mitchell,"Okay, so, this is why I was rushing you around. Huh? What do you think of me now?"
Cameron,"How could you, Mitchell?"
Mitchell,What? Cameron. Cameron.
Cameron,Not now. Donald!
Luke,You do fun stuff. You put that potato chip in my sandwich. That was a crunchy surprise.
Claire,"Nope, that was your dad. Everything fun is your dad. Second Christmas, Italian-accent night... this race."
Luke,Which we could've won. Your way is way faster.
Claire,"It is, isn't it? Buckle up, Luke. Today you have two fun parents."
Luke,"Come on, mom. You can do it."
Claire,That's right I can.
Gloria,"Tell me the truth, Jay. Did you put the key in my bag?"
Jay,No.
Gloria,I won't be mad.
Jay,"In order to prove a point, I may have..."
Gloria,I knew it! Ow!
Jay,Why did I get you such a big watch?!
Gloria,"Why, Jay?! What point did you have to prove?!"
Jay,"I'm trying to teach you to be organized. Your mind is scattered, Gloria."
Gloria,"Your mind is gonna be scattered. Manny, hand me the gun!"
Cameron,"I appreciate the gesture, and I'm not proud of how I'm feeling right now, but the fact is, you cheated on me."
Mitchell,In what way did I cheat on you?
Cameron,"You cheated on me with choreography, and that is the worst kind."
Mitchell,"Well, it really isn't."
Cameron,"You danced without me, Mitchell!"
Phil,"If I'd known it was my last summer there, I'd have gone for the lead in ""pippin."""
Alex,"Dad, look up ahead. Coming at us. There's mom! Beat her!"
Haley,I don't think he's in the mood for that right now.
Alex,"Hold on. No. If ever a man needed a win, it's this man."
Haley,"What do you say, dad?"
Phil,Okay. This one's for family camp.
Alex,Whoo!
Haley,Whoo-hoo!
Claire,This is so inappropriate!
Luke,I love you!
Manny,"Mom, look out!"
Gloria,Ay!
Mitchell,Cam! Anybody hurt?
Manny,"I was almost too depressed to come today. I realized I let my childhood slip away. Look at Luke there... making one big straw out of three. Never change, Luke. I really thought it was too late for me. But watching all you acting like children, it hit me... I've got plenty of time left to be a kid. Anyway, happy birthday to me."
Cameron,: I have been a child.
Jay,I'm sorry I hid the keys.
Gloria,I'm sorry I shoot the island. Mmm.
Phil,We're totally racing home.
Claire,I'm way ahead of you. As usual.
Manny,They say it's going to be a rainy weekend.
Jay,They don't know.
Manny,I do. My knee's been singing all morning.
Jay,Unbelievable. Mother of g...
Gloria,Put them down and walk away.
Jay,"You know, Gloria..."
Haley,So the rate of defusion equals... something.. times the square root of... Something... I give up.
Alex,"Aw, so close."
Haley,Shut up.
Haley,"They're fat, though, right?"
Claire,"Come on, Alex. It's time for your Cello lesson. How's the tutoring going?"
Alex,"Are you familiar with the term ""Throwing good money after bad""?"
Haley,"Are you familiar with the term ""Dunphy, party of one""? Because you will be."
Claire,Girls.
Claire,"Good. Good. Well, the key is to take a lot of little breaks so you don't get frustrated and want to quit."
Haley,Got it.
Claire,"I was talking to David. Come on, Sweetie."
Alex,"I'm just saying... She's never gonna get a job, and how do we know the right middle-eastern businessman wouldn't treat her great?"
Claire,"I left my shopping list inside. For the record, we thought she could live with you."
Alex,Like I'm gonna tell any of you where I live.
Claire,Oh. Haley!
Haley,What? We only do this when I get one right.
Cameron,Momma should be here by now. I wonder what's keeping her.
Mitchell,"Well, Cam, that depends. Did she take her jalopy or one of them new fancy flyin' machines?"
Cameron,"You know, Missouri is more Cosmopolitan than you give it credit for, Mitchell. It's got a very vibrant cowboy-poetry scene."
Mitchell,I'm not sure you're making the point that you think...
Cameron,That's her. Come on. Look alive. Look alive. Momma!
Cameron,Mwah! Mwah!
Mitchell,"Aah, hey, Barb!"
Cameron,"Ohh! Oh-ho! Oh, yeah!"
Cameron,"Well, I don't want to overstate this, but my mom is the greatest woman that ever lived."
Mitchell,Cam loves his mom.
Cameron,"She raised 4 kids, 2 barns, and a whole lot of hell."
Mitchell,"Well, that sounds like a country song."
Cameron,"And that song would be called ""The greatest woman that ever lived."""
Mitchell,Cam loves his mom.
Mitchell,"From the minute I met Barb, she has been open and loving and... and caring."
Mitchell,Ooh...Aah...
Mitchell,If I had one complaint... and I do... it's the inappropriate putting of her hands on my body.
Mitchell,"Hey, Barb. I got you the cranberries you wanted for the stuffing."
Mitchell,Oh!
Mitchell,It's been... It's been going on a long time.
Gloria,"Jay, you want to go to the mall with me?"
Jay,"No, actually, my stomach's a little funny today."
Gloria,"Oh, I am so sorry, Papi. Maybe we'll stop first at the crib store, and you lay down, and I buy you a little dress, huh?"
Jay,Gloria thinks Americans are babies.
Gloria,"Well, in Colombia, we couldn't go running to the hospital for every little sniffle or dislocated shoulder."
Gloria,Okay. Good. 5-6. I serve. Huh?
Manny,"Jay, what are your symptoms? Nausea, bloating?"
Gloria,"Manny, what did I say about getting off that crazy doctor website?"
Manny,I'm just worried about Jay. Stomach pains can mean a lot of things... intestinal blockage... Do you have a fever?
Gloria,"Stop it! Manny, he's fine. Tell him you're fine."
Jay,I'm fine.
Gloria,"Okay, good. Get in the car."
Jay,"Uh, home fine, not mall fine."
Gloria,"Jay, you know what happens when I shop angry."
Jay,I'll clear a space.
Gloria,Mm.
Manny,I'm not loving your color.
Jay,Go play.
Manny,Don't be a hero.
Alex,"So, dumb guys go for dumb girls, and smart guys go for dumb girls? What do the smart girls get?"
Phil,Cats mostly.
Claire,"So, Haley, how long have I been paying this guy to make out with you?"
Haley,"Uh, about a week. First it was just to shut him up, but now I'm starting to like him."
Claire,"If you really like him, though, you have to break up with Dylan."
Phil,What? No!
Claire,Believe me... and it's best for everybody if you just do it quickly.
Phil,I can't believe we're having this conversation. He's like part of the family.
Claire,Trust me... It's the right thing to do. Just end it.
Phil,"Okay, but be gentle. Boys are surprisingly sensitive at that age."
Claire,Water-polo-girl story.
Phil,"Yes, I'm gonna tell the water-polo-girl story, 'cause it hurt! Okay, so I'm working in the principal's office. She walks in, hair all silver from the chlorine... Tells me she wants her varsity jacket back. I tear up a little, then I tear up a lot. I'm begging, I'm begging... at some point I realize I'm sitting on the button to the high-school intercom system. Yuk it up, ladies. Wasn't funny then, is not funny now. It was traumatic, Haley. Don't do Dylan like Linda ""The Cannon"" did me."
Claire,"Oh, honey... That was a long time ago."
Phil,I loved her.
Claire,Okay. I know.
Phil,You know what? Maybe I'll call Dylan after he talks to Haley. He's gonna need someone to lean on.
Claire,"But that someone should not be his ex-girlfriend's father. Honey, when Dylan is out of her life, he should be out of ours."
Phil,You've always hated Dylan.
Claire,"I have not always hated Dylan. I have always thought that Haley could do better. Plus, the new boyfriend is super smart."
Haley,It's done. We broke up.
Phil,What?!
Haley,I texted Dylan. It's over.
Phil,I'll bet that's him. Yep. Sad-face emoticon! You can feel the hurt through the phone!
Mitchell,Cam's mom spend half of dinner with her hands all over me. Oh. It was like she was blind and wanted to know what my thighs looked like.
Claire,"Are you sure? I mean, are you really the best judge of this kind of a thing? You've had boundary issues since you were a kid."
Mitchell,I have not!
Claire,Okay. Sorry. My mistake. Must be Cam's mom... her issues.
Mitchell,What are you doing?
Claire,Nothing... Just getting a spoon.
Mitchell,Stop it.
Claire,Is it bothering you?
Mitchell,"Yes, it is."
Claire,"Hey, Mitchell"
Mitchell,"Claire, stop it! Stop it!"
Claire,"Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell..."
Mitchell,Force field!
Claire,That never stops being fun.
Mitchell,"Good. Listen, this is... This is not in my head, Claire. And it's actually getting worse."
Claire,What does Cam say?
Mitchell,"Well, he never seems to notice. And I certainly can't talk to him about it because God forbid I say anything negative about his mom. One time I added salt to her casserole... And he went into the garage and punched the car."
Claire,"Okay, Mitchell, if this is happening... and I'm pretty sure it isn't..."
Mitchell,Thank you. Supportive.
Claire,Then you need Cam to see his mom feeling you up and then make Cam deal with it.
Mitchell,Ew.
Claire,"Think about it. Hi, Dylan."
Claire,"Actually, I think we're gonna stick with ""Mrs. Dunphy."" Come on in. How are you doing?"
Claire,"To be fair, Dylan, that is a family portrait."
Claire,"Oh, sure. Yeah."
Claire,"Oh, don't look on the bookshelf! You're just gonna..."
Jay,"Hey, kid, you got a minute? I need the name of that medical website."
Manny,Can this wait until I'm home? I'm having the round of my life.
Jay,"I've been thinking, I might have a couple of those,"
Manny,"Uh, I see. You might as well play through. It's gonna be a while."
Jay,"I mean, I'm probably wrong, but, you know, I just, uh, want to make sure."
Gloria,Is that Manny?
Jay,"Work. So, uh, tell them I'll... I'll get that order out this afternoon, huh?"
Manny,Did she buy that? Because it sounded fake on this end.
Jay,"I'll talk to you later, Tom. Tom."
Gloria,Mm.
Phil,"Dylan! Oh, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan."
Phil,"Hey, now that you guys are broken up, you can call me whatever you want. Phil, Vitamin p., P. Daddy."
Phil,"Okay. I'm gonna miss that bad boy. When I forget my own axe, sometimes I come in here and noodle on it. Actually, I've been writing a little song of my own. Might be able to pluck out a few..."
Phil,Weird... this is kind of what my song's about.
Phil,"Hey... I know this is tough, but you're gonna be fine. You know, I was a lot like you in High School... except my hair was shorter and my guitar was a flute."
Phil,"Oh, I don't... I don't know if that's such a good idea."
Phil,"Uh, what... what the hell? Yeah! Let's go guitar shopping."
Phil,Okay. All right.
Phil,"Okay. You... you, uh, you can go ahead and exit through the...Front door."
Cameron,My old yearbook!
Cameron,"Oh! Ho ho! Oh, look."
Cameron,"""You're the cutest boy in school. We're gonna have an awesome summer. Smooches... Brenda."" Oh, Brenda, you are about to have the most confusing summer of your life."
Mitchell,"Hey, guys!"
Mitchell,"Ah. Oh! Oh, Barb, oh, you are such a good hugger."
Cameron,Isn't she the best hugger?
Mitchell,"Oh, and look what I... I got you, Barb."
Mitchell,Scratchers!
Cameron,"Oh, that's your tea. I'm gonna get your tea."
Mitchell,"Oh. Let me have that. Oh, wow, yeah, feel free to fish around in there. Cam? Cam. I'd like a cup, too, please."
Cameron,Just a second.
Mitchell,"Ohh, Barb, ohh. You know what? I-I-I strained myself so bad today."
Mitchell,"It's this area between my, uh, lower back and upper thigh."
Mitchell,It's my Fanny. It's really knotted up.
Mitchell,"Ohh, I would love that. Just... It's really seized up. Just put your fingers all over my... My Fanny. Your magic fingers... Barb."
Cameron,Momma? Your tea. Mitchell?
Cameron,See you in the room for a minute? Thank you. It's very hot. Don't burn your tongue.
Cameron,"Okay, I am not gonna cry, but I want to know why, Mitchell, why you are presenting to my mother like a baboon."
Mitchell,I wanted you to see her fondling me.
Cameron,"So, you do want me to cry."
Mitchell,"No, no, Cam, it's just that... She's always touching me inappropriately, and you never seem to notice."
Cameron,"Show me, Mitchell. Show me on Lily's doll where my mother is touching you."
Mitchell,"I know that you don't want to hear this, but she's handsy, and it makes me uncomfortable."
Cameron,"Oh, my God. I know what this is. You're just not used to having a mother that shows affection."
Mitchell,"Oh, do not make this about my mother."
Cameron,I didn't. But it is normal for a mother to be physical. And it is not strange for an occasional hug or a little pat on tanny.
Mitchell,"Okay, these aren't pats, Cam... no. She squeezes and lingers!"
Cameron,Show me where she squeezes and lingers.
Mitchell,"Cam, put the doll down. I don't know if this is just sexual or... or crazy town, but your mother cannot keep her hands off of me, and it's creeping me out No. Oh... Barb..."
Cameron,Let me show you where you stabbed my momma.
Phil,"Thanks for helping me pick out my axe. You were so right, by the way. The one with two necks would have been overkill."
Phil,"Diet starts tomorrow! Don't tell Mrs. Dunphy about this, either."
Phil,She's a girl with strong opinions... like her mother. Claire hates this new sweatshirt I bought. She says it looks like something a girl would wear to the beach.
Phil,"But I wear it anyway. See? I figure, why be alive if you can't do the things you're passionate about? What are you passionate about, Dylan?"
Phil,Fun! What else?
Phil,"Yeah! No, you don't really know what they're gonna do. The point is, you got your whole life ahead of you. Enjoy being single. I really got to play that song for you. This is all in there."
Phil,Awesome. Be right back.
Haley,"Hey, hey, come here. Is that guy over there with someone?"
Haley,Could you tell if there was anything going on between them?
Haley,He just wants to go 'cause he thinks it's an amusement park!
Manny,"I got to tell you, this is looking more and more like diverticulitis."
Jay,Do they say how to treat it? Like a heating pad or... Ohh!... There it is again.
Manny,"Well, describe the pain."
Jay,"It's like I'm being stabbed, but also like I ate a bad scallop that's stabbing me from the inside."
Manny,"That's colorful, but there's no box for that."
Gloria,What are you guys looking at?
Jay,Girls!
Manny,Huffington post... Girls.
Gloria,"Manny, let me see that screen. What did I tell you?"
Jay,It's not his fault. I asked him to look. I'm starting to think I have a serious problem here.
Gloria,"Yes, you do! That computer! You read it there, you think it here, you feel it here. You want to feel better? There... you're cured."
Jay,"Give me 15 minutes, then tell Florence Nightingale I went to the hospital."
Haley,I'm gonna kill her! I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill both of them!
Claire,What happened?
Haley,Dylan has a new girlfriend!
Phil,When did that happen?
Claire,Who cares?
Phil,I'm just surprised he didn't say anything... to you.
Haley,He's not answering my texts. How could he do this to me?!
Claire,"Oh, honey, you were the one who broke up with him."
Haley,I didn't think he was gonna find someone so fast! Maybe he's better than I thought.
Claire,"No, he's not. What? No, he's not better! No, you know who's better? David... David the tutor. Smart, smart David? Maybe that's him right now! Do you want the house to yourself? For just a little while."
Haley,Who is she?
Haley,"Your new girlfriend. I need her name and address, so I can mess her up."
Haley,"Don't play dumb, Dylan."
Haley,"I saw you at that stupid restaurant, sharing a sundae with her ugly sweatshirt on the chair. Oh, is that the skank?"
Haley,"Well, then why aren't yo answering it!"
Haley,"Well, I want to talk to her. I'm gonna call her back and tell her to keep her hands off of what belongs to me."
Phil,Hello.
Haley,Dad?
Phil,Haley?
Haley,Oh...My...God... the sweatshirt? That was you with Dylan?!
Claire,"Wait, you're the other girl?"
Phil,"No, we're just friends!"
Claire,"Phil, what are you..."
Phil,Shh!
Claire,"Okay, put the phone down. What is going on?"
Phil,He needed someone to talk to. He took the break-up pretty hard.
Claire,But...
Haley,You did?
Haley,"Me too, baby."
Claire,Nice.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Haley,"So, we're still broken up?"
Haley,Wow. Okay... Um... I don't know... I'll see you.
Claire,Bye.
Gloria,"Are you okay, baby? Do you need another pillow?"
Jay,"I know you think this is nothing, but he did say it could be an ulcer."
Gloria,He also said it could be gas. Do you want me to burp you? Come here. Come here.
Manny,"Dollars to doughnuts, it's diverticulitis."
Gloria,Aha!
Jay,I told you it was something. Aha!
Gloria,That can't be right. You have to check again!
Gloria,"No, Jay, if that's true, then I'm the worst wife in the whole wide world! I made you suffer for two whole days!"
Jay,"Honey, it's okay."
Gloria,"No, it's not okay! Why?! Why do I always almost kill my husbands?!"
Jay,"And I want to hear this story sometime, but I'm sort of counting down to a rupture here!"
Gloria,No!! You can't go without forgiving me! What if you die in there? What do I do without you?!
Jay,"I forgive you, but nobody dies of an appendectomy!"
Manny,"True, it's usually the anesthesia that gets you. You're over 60, right?"
Gloria,"I will never forget you, Jay!!"
Jay,"Could you go back to not caring, please?!"
Mitchell,"Ohh, Barb. I'm so sorry."
Mitchell,"Barb, it's my fault, too."
Mitchell,"Yes, yes, of course."
Mitchell,"Uh, Cam?"
Cameron,What is it?
Cameron,"Oh, great. Let me get my camera!"
Mitchell,"Okay, that's not necessary... No!"
Mitchell,No!
Mitchell,Force field! Force field!
Cameron,What's going on?
Cameron,"Momma! Listen, I think this might be one of those situations where Mitchell feels like you're crossing a boundary."
Cameron,Yeah.
Cameron,Yeah.
Mitchell,It's okay! It's okay.
Cameron,Yeah. Absolutely. Scooch together there.
Cameron,Okay.
Phil,Hey.
Haley,I miss him.
Phil,Yeah. He was your first real boyfriend.
Haley,"I keep expecting him to show up. He used to come by at night, and I'd sneak out to see him."
Phil,"Yeah, I know."
Haley,You knew?
Phil,His car is 30 years old and doesn't have a muffler. And he honked.
Haley,I loved that car.
Phil,"I rode in it to the guitar store. I felt like I was flying. I know it hurts now, sweetheart, but... that's how you know it was a relationship worth having."
Haley,"Thanks, Dad."
Phil,"So Dylan are you loving Graceland?... Yeah, that's true. Probably would be cooler if they had roller coasters. Still, it's fun to see where the king lived, huh?... No. No, no, no. That's just an expression. America doesn't have a king. ... Yeah. Oh, sure.... Uh- huh... When?... Well, that's not always the case. Huh?... So, Dylan, did you get a chance to listen to that song I sent you?... No? You got seven minutes?"
Claire,Okay. I'll... I'll get that. Hello?
Jay,"Hey, Manny's getting his outfit together for the dance tonight."
Claire,I was just taking some supplies out to the car. Isn't this exciting... The boys' first dance?
Jay,Greatest day of my life. Does Phil have a green pocket square for him?
Manny,Teal!
Jay,Teal.
Claire,I don't know. I don't think Phil's really a pocket-square kind of a guy.
Phil,Wow! Wow.
Claire,Why don't we conference in Mitch?
Gloria,Ay! Look. This might work.
Manny,"Well, except that it's turquoise... Oh, and a bra?!"
Gloria,Do you think the kids in my village had pocket squares?
Manny,Here we go with the village.
Claire,"Dad, are you still there?"
Jay,"Unfortunately, yes."
Gloria,Please ask Claire what time do I need to be at the school to help set up.
Jay,Gloria wants to know...
Claire,"No, I heard. I heard. Um, tell her thank you so much, but we have all the help we could possibly need, and she doesn't even have to come tonight. She doesn't want to."
Jay,Claire said...
Gloria,I heard.
Mitchell,Hello?
Claire,"Oh, hey, Mitch! Where are you?"
Mitchell,"Oh, we're at the park. You would not believe how some of these people dress their kids. Lily's friend just pulled a Britney Spears getting out of a sandbox car."
Claire,"So, dad's on the line."
Jay,Do you have a teal pocket square for Manny?
Mitchell,"Cam, Manny needs a teal pocket square."
Cameron,"Oh, I've got teal, I've got aqua, I've got sea foam..."
Mitchell,"Yeah, Cam's got one. Cam's got one."
Manny,Yes!
Cameron,"Oh, you know what? I lent it to Andre."
Mitchell,Ah. He lent it to Andre.
Jay,Flag on the play.
Manny,What's that mean? What's that mean?!
Jay,Now I got to go to the mall.
Luke,Is this okay?
Claire,"Oh, hey! Luke has to go to the mall, too."
Luke,What?
Claire,Phil.
Phil,"Let's go, Incredible Hulk."
Mitchell,Hi.
Cameron,Hi.
Mitchell,Yes. Look at her.
Cameron,Yes.
Mitchell,"Oh, no."
Cameron,"Oh, my goodness. I... I don't even know what to say."
Mitchell,She's never done anything like that before. How did it happen?
Mitchell,Uh-huh.
Cameron,Mm-hmm.
Mitchell,It's time to play everyone's favorite game.
Cameron,"""Let's blame the gay dads""!"
Mitchell,You know who had straight parents? Adolf Hitler.
Cameron,Charles Manson.
Mitchell,Shall we go on?
Cameron,Naomi Campbell.
Mitchell,"Oh. Wow, yeah. Oh, gosh, someone really sunk their teeth into you, huh? It's 'cause you're such a yummy little guy! Yes! Our daughter didn't do that."
Mitchell,"Right. He's probably just confused. You know who I bet did it, though? Billy. Rhymes with Lily. Plus, he is very aggressive."
Cameron,"His babysitter's right over there. She's... she's not much of a disciplinarian. Ohh. Because I can assure you, if our child did something like this, we would be on her like white on rice. And I know that sounds a little bit like a racial slur because we're white and she presumably likes rice, but I didn't intend it that way."
Jay,Ah. Finally. There's a spot.
Phil,"Oh. Guys, I am just bursting with pride right now. Your first dance. Soon you're gonna be men. I want you to know that there's more to being a man than just shopping for fancy outfits."
Jay,"Yep. Pretty soon, you get some hair on your chest, you start answering the phone, people don't think you're ladies. Come on, today, Miss Daisy."
Manny,"Actually, Miss Daisy was the one being driven, not the one driving."
Jay,Never saw it.
Manny,"It's called ""Driving Miss Daisy."""
Jay,You got a real lip on you today. You know that? Hey! That was our spot! What are you doing? You're gonna let him snake your spot?
Phil,Not worth it.
Jay,"Boys, here's the only thing you got to know about being a man... never let someone take what is yours."
Phil,Unless it's just a parking spot and there's plenty of others.
Jay,"That's sweet, Phil. You ought to write that down. You got any lipstick in your purse?"
Phil,"I love Jay. Are you kidding me? He's my boy. Yeah, he gives me a hard time, but that's the deal with a father-in-law. The key is, I never let him see just how much it devastates me."
Phil,"It's ""Dunphy."""
Jay,"That's what I said... ""Dumphy."""
Phil,"No, not ""dumb."" ""Dunphy."""
Jay,"""Dumphy."""
Phil,"Say ""done."""
Jay,Done.
Phil,"Say ""fee."""
Jay,Fee.
Phil,"""Done-fee."""
Jay,"""Dumphy."""
Claire,"All right, just bring it this way? This way... There it is. Perfect. Thank you. Perfect."
Claire,What?
Claire,"Oh, gosh. Okay. Gus, stop scaring Bethenny and fix the light, please? Don't make me come over there."
Claire,"Is this because I said I wouldn't come to the dance with you? Gus, I'm a married woman. People would talk."
Claire,"Yeah, I already have a husband who doesn't fix lights. Please?"
Gloria,"Hola, hola! I'm here!"
Claire,"Oh, you came anyway. That's great."
Gloria,"I think it's great, too."
Gloria,"A few weeks ago, they asked for someone to be in charge of the school dance, and I volunteered."
Claire,"The school asks for volunteers so that everybody will feel included, but who are they kidding? They want me to do it. I've put on every school dance since Haley was 12. It's my thing."
Gloria,"They made us co-chairs, which means we're supposed to do everything together, but Claire won't take any of my ideas."
Claire,"She suggested an ""Arabian Nights"" theme. Isn't it a little soon?"
Claire,"Okay. Um, hey, everybody? Do you know Gloria, Manny's mom? She's here to help us out today."
Gloria,I'm the co-chair.
Claire,"So, the kids are gonna be here in two hours, so everybody back to work."
Gloria,Everybody back to work.
Claire,I just said that.
Gloria,And I just co-said it.
Cameron,"I mean, the nerve of that lady accusing Lily?"
Mitchell,"Ugh! Mm. Well, you know what? You can't change people, Cam. I mean, we just have to rise above."
Cameron,Ow! Ow!
Mitchell,What happened?
Cameron,She bit me.
Mitchell,Are you serious?
Cameron,"Ohh! Ah! She did it again! It's like ""Twilight"" back here!"
Cameron,"Okay. Okay. Go. Go. Yeah. Go, go, go. Okay. Drive."
Manny,Are you sure this is teal? 'Cause I'm starting to get a real strong green thing here.
Jay,That's the fluorescent lights.
Manny,Do you mind if I walk this over to lamps galore?
Jay,I need you to worry about this less.
Phil,Guess who fit into the suit on the mannequin and saved us 20%?
Luke,Here's something I didn't know about mannequins... They don't have a wiener.
Manny,What the heck is that?
Phil,"It's a nicer word for ""penis."""
Manny,"No, I mean, what the heck is this?"
Luke,It's a tie.
Manny,It's teal. Luke I don't care. I just grabbed the first one I saw.
Manny,"Well, grab a different one."
Luke,No! Now I like it.
Jay,"Uh, I think we were here first."
Jay,So are we.
Phil,That's fine. Go ahead.
Jay,Seriously?
Phil,"Jay, it's not a big deal."
Jay,"Oh, for God's sake! Now, this is what I'm talking about, boys. You give people an inch, they'll run all over you."
Phil,Or you could just be nice...
Jay,Pay it forward.
Phil,They don't make movies out of bad ideas.
Jay,"All I know is you got to fight for what you want. If there's one job available, this guy just got it, and they go hungry at the ""Dumphys'."""
Phil,"""Dunphys'."""
Mitchell,"Okay, I don't get it. Why is she biting? Lily, why are you biting?"
Cameron,She's not biting. She's teething.
Mitchell,"On people! All right, if she starts biting her play dates, she's gonna be a pariah."
Cameron,"Try ""piranha."""
Mitchell,"Really, Cam?"
Cameron,It was right there.
Mitchell,"All right, you should also know that I in no way... in no way... blame you."
Cameron,"Well, thank you. Why would you blame me?"
Mitchell,I don't.
Cameron,"Well, good, because I don't blame you."
Mitchell,"Well, obviously."
Cameron,"Uh, okay, well, now I'm starting to feel the blame."
Mitchell,No. No. Don't... It's... It's just that you're with her all day.
Cameron,"Oh, wow. I have a daughter who bites and a partner who stings."
Mitchell,"Okay. Okay, you want to know the truth? Sometimes you've sent her some mixed signals."
Cameron,I'm gonna bite your feet! I'm gonna bite 'em right off!
Cameron,"Oh, I'm not the one who uses my teeth like a multi-tool."
Mitchell,Here we go. Cookies for Lily...And wine for us. Okay.
Mitchell,I can't believe you would equate...
Cameron,"Oh, don't bite my head off. I'm not a pack of batteries."
Gloria,"Un poquito mã¡s acã¡. Es perfecto allã­. Ay, good. Bellissimo."
Claire,Whoa!
Gloria,Eeh!
Claire,Why is this box here?!
Gloria,"I am sorry... we did, because we were moving the tables."
Claire,"Well, why are you moving the tables?"
Gloria,So the kids have more space to dance. It's better this way.
Claire,"Is it really, Gloria? Because right now it kind of just looks like a clump of tables and a big open space. Look, I'm sorry, but we've always done it this way, and I think it's gonna throw people off if you move them around."
Gloria,I did!
Gloria,Hello. We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Gloria.
Claire,"No. No, Bethenny. No one's ever told her that."
Claire,You know what? Let's just put a pin in where we're gonna put the tables.
Gloria,"Yes, we're keeping the tables! So what else can I do?"
Claire,Um...You can... Help me with the chairs.
Gloria,Okay.
Claire,We need a lot of them. They're under the stage right...Here. There you go.
Gloria,"It's like dirty and dark there, no?"
Claire,"Yeah, I know. Bummer, right?"
Gloria,Ay!
Claire,Off you go.
Gloria,"Smells funny, Claire!"
Claire,So sorry. Keep goin'!
Claire,What? We needed chairs.
Gloria,There are ants all over.
Gloria,"No, you need to clean them before the children get here."
Claire,What are you guys talking about?
Gloria,"No, nothing. He was just saying how much he loves the tables."
Manny,"At this rate, I'm going to miss the first dance... at my wedding!"
Luke,I thought he only had one item.
Jay,"Tell your dad, if it were up to me, we'd have been in and out of here in about 10 minutes."
Phil,You mentioned that.
Jay,"And I'll probably mention it again, because, thanks to someone, we're gonna be here for a while."
Phil,"Yeah, I get it."
Jay,"You know, Luke, you should order that suit in a larger size, because by the time we get out of here..."
Phil,I...get...it.
Jay,Pay for the suit. Where the hell are you going?
Phil,Luke needs...Socks.
Luke,Make 'em teal!
Manny,You're playing a very dangerous game.
Jay,"Hey, boys... Look who it is... the guy that stole our parking spot."
Luke,Are you going to hit him? I'd totally hit him.
Jay,"I'm not gonna hit him, but I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind. Now, boys, pay attention... You want to be men, this is how you handle a jerk like this. Hey, chief? You know, you stole our parking space today."
Jay,"That's right. I was waiting for the parking space, you sneaked right in there... That make you feel like a big man?"
Jay,That's no excuse.
Jay,You know what? Forget about the... spot.
Luke,Do not hit him.
Phil,"That's funny. You made that sound like a question, then you didn't wait for me to answer."
Phil,"Here, let me show you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go... You go, ""Oasis for Men?"" You see what I mean? You went, ""Oasis for Men? You should have said, ""Oasis for Men?"" Then I'd go, ""yeah, give me two."" But instead, you went, ""Oasis for Men."""
Phil,You see what I mean?
Phil,"No, I'm not sure you do! You sprayed before ""men""! You went, ""Oasis for Men."""
Phil,Men! Men! Men!
Phil,Men! Men! Men! Men!
Phil,Men! Men! Men! Men!
Phil,Men! Men! Men! Men! Men!
Jay,"Hey, Phil."
Phil,Hey. I don't know what happened. I just... I... I don't know what happened.
Jay,"Look, I might've come down on you a little bit hard today. I'm sorry."
Phil,I remember pretending to go look for some socks...
Jay,"I mean, it's, uh, my fault. I pushed your buttons. My father- in-law was the same way with me. He was horrible."
Phil,Grandpa Lucas? He was a sweetheart.
Jay,"Yeah, after the stroke mellowed him out good. Before? An animal."
Phil,We named Luke after him.
Jay,"Everything I did was wrong. If I said it was white, he'd say it was black. Although he never said anything was black 'cause he was a pretty big racist."
Phil,I wear his watch.
Jay,I hated him. Hated him. And I was thinking... I don't know... I don't want you to think the same way about me.
Phil,You ever think about maybe not being a jerk to me so much?
Jay,"Now, see, you got to stop taking that stuff personally. I'm like that with everybody! I'm tough!"
Phil,And...mean.
Jay,I don't like to take guff!
Phil,Or people's feelings into consideration.
Jay,"Okay, okay. I can't swear my way's the right way. I see you smiling, skipping around, and I think sometimes... I don't know... maybe the boys would be better off if they were a little bit more like you."
Phil,"You know, skipping burns more calories than running. That's..."
Jay,"We're done here. Oh, hey, listen. He didn't tell me, but what'd you do to that guy, huh? Did you get him?"
Phil,"Yeah, I sprayed him with cologne."
Jay,I'm sorry I asked.
Phil,"No, but, like, a lot of cologne. I just, like, got way up in there."
Jay,Good boy.
Cameron,Did you find anything yet?
Mitchell,"Yes, there's a whole section on biting on this mommy forum."
Cameron,"Oh, good. What does it say?"
Mitchell,"Uh, ""my son was biting, ""so I got a stranger to yell at him. ""Being disciplined by someone else outside the family scared him into stopping."""
Cameron,Idiots!
Mitchell,Cam!
Cameron,"What? I am not hiring some hobo to come over here and traumatize my child. She's already prone to flashbacks, if you know what I mean."
Mitchell,"Yeah, you know she didn't fight in Vietnam, right?"
Cameron,I don't know anything anymore. What else does it say?
Mitchell,"Okay, well, this one says, ""when my daughter bit her brother, ""I put a pinch of pepper in her mouth."" ""She cried and cried, but she never bit again."" Smiley face."
Cameron,"Oh, well, the smiley face makes it okay. ""I waterboarded our toddler... LOL!"""
Mitchell,"Well, all right, what do you suggest we do?"
Cameron,"That we log off the Spanish inquisition website and handle this with love. Okay, Lily... *Take a bite of an apple, take a bite of a pear, take a bite of the cookie that you left over there. Here's one thing you should never do don't bite Taylor or Brandon or Sue because people aren't food people aren't food your friends will run away if they're scared of being chewed and as a side note, private parts are private.*"
Mitchell,Well... problem solved.
Cameron,"I know you're being sarcastic, but you don't know that it's not. Ow! Honey."
Mitchell,Did she just bite you again?
Cameron,No.
Mitchell,That is it. I am getting the pepper!
Cameron,"N... no, you are not."
Mitchell,"Cam, you're not doing her any favors by being soft."
Cameron,"Oh, well, then, why don't you just skip the pepper, I'll get some pliers, and we'll pull her teeth now!"
Mitchell,Relax! It's a seasoning.
Cameron,"Okay. Well, then, why don't you try some?"
Mitchell,Stop.
Cameron,No. Try a little.
Mitchell,"Stop it. Stop it, Cam. Stop it."
Cameron,"No, try a little bit. Don't you hit me. Here. Put some in there."
Mitchell,No!
Cameron,Ow! You bit me! Mm!
Mitchell,Well... Why don't you sing me a song about it?
Claire,"Oh, look at you two in your matching ties!"
Manny,Don't get me started.
Claire,"Ohh, come here. Luke, sweetie, are you wearing cologne?"
Luke,No. Dad attacked the perfume guy and then hugged me.
Claire,"I saw the boys in those adorable little suits, and it made me realize this dance is about them. It's not about me and my petty little competition with... with Gloria."
Gloria,Just look at the walls in here. Who wears that to a kids' dance?
Claire,"Oh, my God. No, I'm fine. I'm... I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I need a paper towel."
Claire,"No... Of course you didn't. Of course you didn't. 'Cause it's Gloria's night. That's right. It's all about Gloria, Gloria, Gloria! When you're done getting married... maybe you can mop this up a little."
Gloria,What was that?
Gloria,"Okay, we need to talk."
Claire,No. I am fine. I do not need to talk.
Gloria,"Well, you've been pushing me away the whole week. You've been fighting all my ideas."
Claire,"That's because this is my thing, Gloria."
Gloria,"Why can't it be my thing, too, Claire?"
Claire,"Because everything is your thing! This... this is the one thing that was my thing. This is my only thing. Oh my God, this is my only thing. And then you come along and you steal my thunder with your tight dresses and your great ideas. I was the one that all the moms looked up to. I was the only one that Gus liked."
Gloria,"Ay! Please. You like him so much, you can keep him."
Claire,"It's not the same now that I know he likes you. That sounds really insane, but this isn't actually about Gus."
Gloria,Really? Because you've been talking a lot about him.
Claire,"Gloria, Gus is a symbol."
Gloria,A sex symbol?
Claire,"Stop it, Gloria. I'm already crying."
Gloria,"Claire... I didn't come here to steal your thunder. Your thunder is your thunder, and my thunder is my thunder."
Claire,I know. It's just that God gave you so much thunder.
Gloria,"Yeah, maybe too much. I hate how those women look at me. You think I don't know what they're thinking? ""Ah, here comes the hot one with the big boobies that is gonna steal my husband."" And maybe they don't let their kids play with Manny. I volunteer because I want them to see that there's so much more to me."
Claire,Why didn't you tell me that?
Gloria,Maybe for the same reason you didn't tell me you had a wed thing for Gus... It's embarrassing.
Claire,"Okay. I am sorry. I made this whole thing into some ridiculous competition, and...I'm pathetic."
Gloria,"You're not pathetic. Okay, that's a little bit sad."
Phil,"We like to think we're so smart and we have all the answers. And we want to pass all that on to our children. But... If you scratch beneath the surface, you don't have to dig very deep to find the kid you were. Which is why it's kind of crazy that now we're raising kids of our own."
Mitchell,You know what? This is a milestone. We're accepting that our little angel isn't perfect.
Cameron,That's right. And it's okay.
Mitchell,I-I take it back... She is perfect.
Phil,"But I guess that's the real circle of life. Your parents faked their way through it, you fake your way through it, and, hopefully, you don't raise a serial killer."
Mitchell,Ow! That's not funny.
Cameron,"I am so sorry... No, just come over. We'll watch a movie, put the whole thing behind you. Okay, see you in a bit. That was Longines. He's in a very bad place."
Mitchell,"Oh, no. What happened?"
Cameron,"Well, apparently some maniac went crazy at the mall and attacked him with Oasis for Men."
Mitchell,"Oh. Well, I think we all knew that day was coming."
Cameron,Mm.
Mitchell,All right. Wish me luck.
Cameron,Good luck.
Mitchell,"Okay, honey. Please don't hurt daddy. All right. ""Ahh."""
Cameron,"Hey. Good night, honey. Mitchell! There's a stranger in our hot tub!"
Mitchell,Who is it?!
Cameron,"You do know what ""stranger"" means, don't you?"
Mitchell,"Oh, my G... Oh, my God! How long has he been there?"
Cameron,I saw him exactly one second before you. You know everything I know.
Mitchell,"Okay, I'm... I'm calling 911."
Cameron,I'm getting my bat.
Mitchell,Maybe we're overreacting.
Cameron,"Yeah, he could have a very good reason for be..."
Mitchell,We should at least say hello.
Cameron,It's only polite.
Mitchell,Whoa.
Cameron,Amazing.
Cameron,"Turns out, Barry just moved into the apartment upstairs and thought the hot tub was for the whole building. Anyway, he's a super-cool guy, and he's straight, so there's no weirdness."
Mitchell,Aside from you turning into a 16-year-old girl.
Cameron,I did not.
Cameron,Okay.
Mitchell,Whatcha doin'?
Mitchell,Okay. Mm.
Cameron,"Now, do you feel that? I do."
Cameron,"It does. It feels warm, Mitchell."
Mitchell,Imagine that. In a hot tub.
Luke,What are you gonna do when he drives by?
Claire,I'm gonna tell him to slow down.
Luke,"I think you should drag him out of his car, and we all get turns punching him in the stomach until he barfs."
Claire,"Honey, I think I'm just gonna turn over his license plate to the police."
Luke,Please. Order a pizza and call the cops. We'll see who gets here first.
Claire,"Ever since they put those speed bumps on Oakmont, some lunatic driver in a crazy sports car has been racing down our street, and it is dangerous. We've got kids here and babies in strollers and moms who like to jog."
Phil,"She has to run every day, or she goes crazy. She's like a border collie."
Claire,You're comparing me to a dog?
Phil,The smartest dogs in the world.
Phil,What are you guys doing?
Luke,What the cops won't.
Claire,"We are catching that speeder, and when we do, he's gonna get an earful of this. Slow down, jerk!"
Phil,Oh! Okay! Easy.
Haley,"Oh, my God. Mom, what are you doing? Why are you being such a freak?!"
Claire,"I am being a freak for safety. And I'm doing this for you, because I don't want anything bad to happen to you."
Haley,"Well, it's embarrassing. Mom, you need a life. Why can't you just volunteer at the museum or bring pudding to old people?"
Claire,"Honey, if anybody's being embarrassing right now, it's you."
Phil,"Luke, I am your father!"
Claire,That takes me back to the delivery room.
Phil,That's what I said to you when you were coming out of your mom's lady parts.
Haley,"Oh, my God, dad! Oh, my God. I know those girls."
Claire,What? Are you ashamed of us?
Haley,Yes!
Phil,Ooh. Sweet valley high! This is that woman from the house on seventh street!
Claire,"Oh, good!"
Phil,"Yeah, if I sell it by the end of next month, I dethrone Gil thorpe as salesman of the quarter."
Claire,Ahh.
Luke,"That's awesome, dad."
Phil,It is awesome. Phil Dunphy.
Claire,"That's the speeder! That's the speeder! Yeah. Slow down, jerk! Slow down!"
Phil,"Yeah. No. Yeah, that's great. Okay, fire away."
Claire,2-u-r-n-8-0-1. Yeah.
Phil,"Oh, uh, just the address. Yep. Okay. 1-0..."
Claire,8-0-1. 2-u-r-n.
Phil,1...North...Seventh...
Claire,8-0-1.
Phil,2...
Luke,I gave it to dad.
Claire,U-r...
Phil,"...Street. Oh, God. Okay. 10-4. This is gonna be my best year since 2006."
Jay,"Let's go, kid. Back to the salt mine."
Manny,"That's okay, Jay. I'm biking to school today."
Jay,Good for you.
Manny,There's a bunch of cool kids who ride their bikes every day. Thought I'd join them.
Jay,"Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What the hell is that?"
Manny,"My new bike. Mom got it for me yesterday. Pretty sweet, huh?"
Jay,Training wheels?
Manny,Nice ones. Custom made. They don't usually come on bikes this size.
Jay,Gloria!
Manny,What's wrong?
Jay,You don't know how to ride a bike?
Manny,I know how to ride this bike.
Jay,Stephen Hawking could ride that bike.
Gloria,Ay. What happened? Did he fall?
Jay,How could he fall? You can't send him to school on a bike with training wheels. They'll make fun of him. Didn't you teach him how to ride a bike?
Gloria,How could I? I don't know how to ride a bike.
Jay,2/3 of my house can't do what a billion Chinese do.
Gloria,"My mother thought that riding a bike was dangerous. She would say, ""that's how people grab you!"""
Jay,"Okay, this is how it's going down. Today I'm driving you to school, on the weekend, I'm buying you a bike, and I'm teaching both of you."
Manny,I'm nervous... but I'm excited.
Gloria,You two have fun. I pass. It makes no sense. There's no reason that thing should stay upright.
Jay,"There's no reason you should stay upright, but it just works."
Phil,"Laura, good day. Well, I couldn't love this entry any more. It's very welcoming."
Phil,"Um, let me run through my three-pronged approach to selling..."
Phil,"Well, there are quite a few factors to take into..."
Phil,"Uh, we list at 1.4. We take anything north of 1.25."
Phil,Great! I got all the paperwork right here.
Phil,"Oh, I had no intention..."
Phil,"Bring it, Laura."
Phil,You want to test me? I've been tested my whole life. They could never find anything.
Phil,"So, uh, Sunday 12:00 to 4:00 for the open house? That works for you?"
Phil,"Great. Oh, and if you have any questions or you need anything, just call. When you work with me, you're working with a friend."
Phil,"Hi. This is Claire. Leave a message. Hey, honey. It's me. I just finished the meeting, and she is the perfect client. Realistic about the price... She wants to sell fast, and she's a real character. You got to...Meet her. But she's moving soon, so what's the point?"
Mitchell,Hey!
Cameron,"Wow, you worked late."
Mitchell,Yes. Brutal day. I just want to sit.
Cameron,"Perfect. Lily's asleep. Barry's meeting us in the hot tub. If you're feeling stressed, he could give you a treatment."
Mitchell,"Ah, that's all right. I have an appointment with Dr. Bigfoot tomorrow."
Cameron,Okay. Here comes the judge.
Mitchell,"Reiki is a bunch of nonsense, Cam. That guy is a nut."
Cameron,"You do this every time. We meet a new friend, they say one thing you don't like, and you just write 'em off."
Mitchell,I do not!
Cameron,"Oh, really? What about ""but yet Rachel""?"
Mitchell,"""I'd love to go, but yet, I don't feel like parking."" It's either ""but"" or ""yet,"" not both."
Cameron,"You're lucky no one's kicked your butt yet. What about Thomas? You wrote him off because he serves the salad after the meal, which, by the way, is very common in Europe."
Mitchell,What part of Europe is he from?
Cameron,"Pretentious-Stan? Okay, fine. Keep judging. Don't let anyone in. I could care less."
Mitchell,"I think you mean you couldn't care less, because if you could care less, that means that you care a little bit."
Cameron,"All right. I'm going to the hot tub. If I stay in here one more minute, my head is literally gonna explode."
Mitchell,"Well, I hope not, because if you mean ""literally""..."
Cameron,I don't feel safe in my own home!
Claire,"Phil, honey, I need your help."
Phil,With what?
Claire,What is the one thing a speeder can't outrun?
Luke,"Ooh. Bullets. A laser. Oh, I know... a falcon! Dad, jump in."
Phil,Not a good time.
Luke,A laser falcon!
Phil,That's awesome.
Haley,"""Slow down your neighbors!""?"
Claire,"No. ""Slow down""... Talking to the speeder... Who's talking to the speeder? Your neighbors."
Luke,It doesn't say that.
Haley,"Yeah, it just says ""slow down your neighbors!"""
Claire,Phil.
Phil,"I know what you were going for, but now all I can see is ""slow down your neighbors!"""
Claire,"Well, you're all wrong, 'cause this is incredibly clear. And it's really important. We need to put these signs up all over the neighborhood."
Phil,I don't know. It seems kind of cowardly.
Claire,Mm.
Phil,Why don't you just make an anonymous call to the police?
Claire,"I called the police, and they were totally unhelpful."
Luke,Surprise. Surprise.
Claire,"Phil, come on. Are you with me or not?"
Phil,Of course I'm with you. Who else would I be with? This guy? I have no connection to this guy.
Claire,Good!
Phil,No! Fine.
Phil,"Before you judge me, I have come in second to Gil thorpe for salesman of the quarter seven quarters in a row. Seven. Nobody remembers second best. Oh, yeah, everybody loves Michael Jordan, but nobody thinks of Scottie Pippen. The only reason I remember him is because he's named after my favorite musical."
Mitchell,Hey. It's Barry.
Mitchell,"Oh. Thanks, Barry. I'll let the gardener know."
Mitchell,"Oh. Oh, God. That was a good one."
Mitchell,Was I that obvious?
Mitchell,"Uh, no, it's true. It's true, no. I-I once saw a picture of myself at a friend's poetry slam, and all you could see were the whites of my eyes. Yeah, I looked like little orphan Annie. The cartoon. Anyway, I'm sorry if I offended you."
Mitchell,'Cause I'm about to pass out!
Manny,Okay! I'm ready!
Jay,Oh. What the hell's he wearing?
Gloria,Protection pads. He needs more?
Jay,"We're riding bikes. We're not training police dogs. All right, kid. Come on. Get on. On board. Attaboy. All right, we ready? Ride!"
Gloria,"Be careful, papi."
Jay,Ignore her.
Jay,"I've seen the kid fall down on that moving sidewalk at the airport, so I didn't have high hopes. But what do you know? The kid was a natural."
Manny,Mom! It's so easy!
Gloria,"Bravo, Manny!"
Jay,I told you!
Gloria,"Be careful with the bump! Hey, wait a minute. Who's that guy? Jay, he's gonna grab him!"
Jay,"Oh, no one's grabbing anyone. It's a neighbor."
Jay,"Gloria, on the other hand, was a natural disaster."
Jay,There are three things you want to do before you ride. Manny.
Manny,"Check your shoelaces, adjust your mirror, and test your bell."
Gloria,"Okay. Shoelaces tied... The mirror is good... ...The bell is ringing. Okay, now what?"
Jay,Ride.
Gloria,"Ay, no, no, no, Jay. Don't push me! I don't want to get hurt!"
Jay,Trust me. I'm not gonna hurt you. You're a work of art. If you get scratched the value goes down I'm making a joke to lighten the mood.
Gloria,It's not working!
Jay,Let's just do this.
Gloria,"Okay. Slowly. Jay, slowly."
Jay,Relax. You're not gonna fall. I got you. Put your feet on the pedals. Now look where you're going. Look where you're going!
Gloria,"No, I'm falling. I'm falling."
Jay,"Look straight ahead. Go, go, go. Pedal!"
Gloria,"No, Jay!"
Jay,What are you ringing the bell for?
Gloria,"Ay! Why you let me go, Jay?! No, no!"
Jay,Pedal! Look where you're going! Look where you're going!
Gloria,"I'm gonna kill you, Jay!"
Jay,Okay. Good day's work. What do you say we hit the jewelry store?
Phil,Laura!
Phil,Taking this...sign down! I recognized your license plate. This is ridiculous!
Phil,Who knows?
Phil,"Or things are so good at home, she's out looking for problems."
Phil,I don't think that's the issue.
Phil,Okay.
Claire,Hey!
Phil,Hey!
Claire,"Oh, my gosh. What happened to my sign?"
Phil,"I don't know! I put it up, I went away, I came back... It was in pieces!"
Claire,This is so crazy.
Phil,"Crazy!! Claire, this whole thing is crazy. Maybe we should back off a little bit."
Claire,"You know what, Phil? No. I am not gonna back off. Okay? I am doing this for the safety of our neighborhood."
Cameron,"Well, what's going on here?"
Cameron,"Oh, well, in that case, we'll be back Tuesday."
Mitchell,"Oh. Barry. Mm. Oh, man, that was... that was great."
Cameron,Namaste. Namaste.
Mitchell,"Oh, no. Hey, don't rustle. We're making dinner tonight. You're coming."
Cameron,"Yeah, come down."
Mitchell,Yes.
Mitchell,What?
Cameron,You know what I'm looking for.
Mitchell,He's a very nice guy.
Cameron,That's not it.
Mitchell,I'm sorry I made a snap judgment.
Cameron,Still not it.
Mitchell,You were right.
Cameron,There she is.
Cameron,Oh. Mrs. Ko. I'm Cameron. Mitchell's the other one. What are you doing here?
Cameron,What do you mean? What about Barry?
Cameron,The new tenant.
Cameron,But...
Gloria,"The problem wasn't me. It was Jay. He's a very bad teacher. Very bossy. I don't respond to that. I need somebody gentle, nurturing, like a woman."
Phil,Hey. Gloria. What's up?
Gloria,Can you teach me how to ride a bike?
Phil,"You can't ride a bike? I love that about you. I was beginning to think you didn't have any flaws. Listen, I wish I could, but I'm late for an open house."
Gloria,Oh.
Phil,Yeah.
Luke,I could teach you.
Gloria,Really?
Luke,Sure. I'm a great bike rider. I've taught a bunch of my friends.
Luke,"I never taught anyone anything. But my playdate canceled, so I was wide open."
Cameron,Barry?
Cameron,What are you doing in there?
Cameron,Are you living in our daughter's princess castle?!
Cameron,You said you had just moved in upstairs.
Cameron,...that you're living in a dollhouse?
Cameron,Yes. Let's do that.
Cameron,No... No!
Cameron,"Oh, my God! You are living in here!"
Cameron,Barry...
Cameron,...Are you homeless?
Cameron,"Okay. I can't even believe I'm having to say this, but you can't... you can't stay here."
Cameron,"No. You are living in a little girl's toy, and you have to move out."
Cameron,"There's no dinner! Dinner is off! Okay? Now, come on. Let's go."
Cameron,You're a massage therapist.
Cameron,"Okay, Barry. Listen to me."
Cameron,You're a very nice man. Mitchell and I like you very much.
Cameron,But I'm...
Cameron,"I'm going to take your hand... Yes, I am. Don't give me the coyote look. I'm not a canine. We're gonna walk out of here together. Mm. Nobody's gonna hurt you."
Cameron,Give me your hand.
Mitchell,Cam?!
Cameron,Mitchell! Call 911!
Mitchell,What's happening?!
Cameron,Barry's a nut! He's been living in Lily's castle!
Mitchell,What?
Cameron,Ow!
Mitchell,"Oh, my God! I thought he was living upstairs!"
Cameron,Just call the police! Do you want me to stop and give you the whole story?!
Cameron,Mitchell! Call 911! Stop pinching!
Mitchell,Okay.
Cameron,"And just for the record, I was right! I still don't think you should judge people! I said get off me!"
Luke,"Okay, Gloria. What scares you about riding a bike?"
Gloria,Losing control and falling down.
Luke,Great. What else?
Gloria,Somebody grabbing me?
Luke,That's weird. What else?
Gloria,Looking foolish.
Luke,"Okay. See, all these bad thoughts are holding you back."
Gloria,Mm. So how do we get rid of these bad thoughts?
Luke,We shoot 'em out!
Gloria,"No, don't you dare!"
Luke,Ride!
Gloria,Don't you dare!
Luke,Ride!
Gloria,"Luke, stop it! No!"
Luke,I said ride!
Gloria,"No, no!"
Luke,Ride!
Gloria,I'm gonna tell your mother!
Luke,What? That you're riding a bike?
Gloria,"No, that you're... Yes! I'm riding the bike! Whoo-hoo!"
Gloria,It was the greatest feeling in the world. Luke was right. There was nothing to be afraid of.
Claire,Get off the bike! Get off the bike! Give it to me! Give it to me!
Gloria,"Ay, don't grab me! No, no! No, don't grab me!"
Claire,"Go, go, go, go, go! Go! Laces, mirror... Bell. Slow down, jerk!"
Phil,Thanks so much for coming. It was great to meet you both. Have a good one! See you later.
Phil,"Hey, great. Lots of people."
Phil,"Oh, actually, I think they meant ""slow down""... talking to you..."
Phil,"""Your neighbors."""
Phil,"Yeah, um, you think maybe it's possible that you do drive a little too fast in a residential neighborhood with children present, maybe, or..."
Claire,Phil? Honey?
Phil,Claire?
Claire,Ohh. God. I had to get some water. I was chasing that crazy maniac. I got so close.
Phil,And you just gave up?
Claire,Mm!
Phil,That's not the Claire that I know. Get back out there!
Claire,Really?
Phil,Yeah!
Phil,"Okay, bye."
Claire,Hey. Hi. I'm Claire Dunphy. I'm Phil's wife.
Phil,Let's not talk her ear off.
Phil,She's got to go.
Claire,"Oh, beautiful house."
Claire,"Hey, are you going by Greenleaf? Mm..."
Claire,"I just overdid it on my bike, and I cannot get back on there."
Phil,That's a terrible idea.
Phil,"I wish I were one of those people who thrives on the danger of leading a double life. You know, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker, Hannah Montana."
Phil,"That's a terrible...idea, because your bike is here. What are you gonna do? Leave it? That's rude!"
Phil,"Whenever?! What's ""whenever""? That's so open-ended."
Claire,Ahh. I love her energy. I'm coming!
Claire,"So, why do you want to move?"
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Claire,"Oh, tell me about it."
Claire,"You know, don't say another word. I bet I know exactly who you're thinking of. Yeah."
Phil,"Claire was furious. She said I betrayed her on every level. So, I called the florist, and I have ordered one dozen mylar balloons. Good luck staying mad, honey."
Phil,"C'mon, which civilization invented the alphabet?"
Haley,I don't know.
Phil,"Yes, you do. We've been over this a hundred times."
Luke,"Allow me, dad. I'm a great teacher. Who invented the alphabet?"
Haley,I...Don't...Know.
Phil,Luke!
Haley,I got soaked! What are you doing?!
Luke,Say it! Say it!
Phil,"Luke, that's enough!"
Haley,"Oh, my God! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! The Phoenicians! The Phoenicians!"
Phil,That's...right.
Luke,Teacher of the year.
Phil,"She's all yours, buddy."
Claire,"Honey, honey, look, look. She's doing that thing with her jaw again."
Phil,Poor kid. She puts so much pressure on herself.
Claire,It's an obsessive-compulsive thing. I have read like 100 articles about it. Where does she get it from?
Phil,"Yeah, it's... it's a mystery."
Claire,"I know. Alex... Honey, hi! Hi, hi, hi. Why don't you take a little break?"
Alex,"Mom, the test is tomorrow morning. I'm not taking any breaks."
Claire,"Just a little... Oh, okay."
Luke,She does that jaw thing every six seconds. It's like the hippopotamus at the miniature-golf place.
Phil,"Ohh, I've bounced so many balls off those big teeth."
Luke,It's all about the timing!
Claire,Luke!
Phil,So close!
Alex,"Stop it, you..."
Claire,"Hey, hey, Luke, go to your room."
Phil,Go on!
Luke,She's got to eat. I did it out of love.
Claire,Go.
Mitchell,Look at her with the little harmonica.
Cameron,I know. She's like a little junior junior Wells. Where did you buy it for her?
Mitchell,"I thought you got it for her. Oh, no. Cam, she must have grabbed it from that store."
Cameron,"Okay. Honey... Listen. Stealing is wrong. Now, we have to go back and pay for it."
Mitchell,"Cam, it's so far away."
Cameron,"No, I'm not going back there."
Mitchell,Tracy?
Mitchell,"Uh, this is... this is Cameron, my partner..."
Mitchell,"And, uh, our daughter, Lily."
Mitchell,"Oh, Cam, this is... this is Tracy."
Cameron,"Oh. ""Tracy"" Tracy."
Mitchell,Yes.
Cameron,"Oh, hi."
Mitchell,"Tracy was my high-school girlfriend. Yes. Yes, it's true. I had girlfriends... quite a few, actually."
Cameron,"I, too, took my fair share of ladies to the hen house. Literally, I did take them to the hen house. That's the only place you could get some privacy on a farm."
Mitchell,: Really? What were these... what were these girls' names?
Cameron,": Oh, well, there was Nellie Forbush..."
Mitchell,Oh...
Cameron,Betty Rizzo... Eliza...
Mitchell,"Doolittle. These are characters from musicals. You're so gay, you can't even think of real girls' names."
Cameron,Kim McAfee... that's a real one.
Mitchell,"""Bye bye birdie""."
Mitchell,What's new?
Mitchell,Th... that's great. How long are you in town for?
Cameron,"Oh, I want to hear all about Mitchell from high school. Did he have a beard?"
Mitchell,But we should... we should all... We should all hang out.
Mitchell,"W... well, take care."
Cameron,Um... Thumpety thump-thump. Look at frosty go!
Mitchell,That was weird.
Cameron,"Well, don't worry about it. It's high school, honey."
Mitchell,"Well, actually..."
Cameron,What?
Mitchell,"At our 10-year reunion, we got a little drunk, started reminiscing, one thing led to another..."
Cameron,You went back?
Mitchell,I... I think I just wanted to see if I could. Turns out I could.
Cameron,Where did this happen?!
Mitchell,"Um, in the nurse's office. I can still hear the crinkling of the paper. After that, I... I didn't return any of her phone calls, and I haven't seen her since."
Cameron,You naughty little girl.
Mitchell,"Well, you know, that's what happens when you give me Kahlua."
Jay,Hello.
Gloria,"Jay, guess who called. The Hoffmans."
Jay,Who?
Gloria,That's right. The ones from the hotel bar in Cabo. They're in town for the night. They want to go to dinner.
Jay,"Oh, hell. The boring guy and the loudmouth?"
Gloria,I know. I was so excited that they called.
Jay,I don't want to see them.
Gloria,I know! So much fun!
Jay,"You're with them right now, aren't you?"
Gloria,"Yes! Ha ha. And they can't wait to see you, too!"
Phil,"Okay, pencils down. You're taking a break."
Alex,"No, I... I can't afford to take a break. Sanjay Patel's not taking a break."
Phil,"Well, obviously, Sanjay's parents don't care about him. Or ""her"". What is that... ""Sanjay""?"
Alex,"Sanjay's the only one in class who might do better than me, and I cannot let that happen."
Claire,"Honey, listen to yourself. It's just not healthy."
Phil,"This is my fault. You see me achieve excellence, and it puts a lot of pressure on you."
Claire,What about me?
Phil,Sorry. Yeah. It puts a lot of pressure on both of you.
Claire,"Thanks, Phil. Okay, come on. Let's go have some fun!"
Alex,No!
Phil,Let's go! Yes!
Phil,"Doesn't this feel good, sweetheart?"
Claire,"It's fun, right?"
Cameron,"Honestly, I think you're overly worried about Lily. It's not like she's gonna grow up to be a thief. And besides, at the end of the day, who does she learn her behavior from? Us. We're her role models. Like mama always said, our children are just miniature versions of us. Come on."
Mitchell,Cam.
Gloria,"Isn't that fun, Jay?"
Jay,"You know, I'm surprised to hear you say that. You've been pretty quiet."
Jay,Listening is your hobby? Sure.
Gloria,"Oh, we would love to!"
Jay,"Okay, let's slow down. You're nice people. We're nice people. But let's be honest... We've all tried to do that thing where we force a friendship that isn't really there. So why don't we just call it a day right now and say goodbye, shake hands, wish each other well?"
Jay,"No, no, but the beauty of it is we're never gonna see each other again, so there's no reason to be uncomfortable."
Gloria,They're staying with us tonight. Their bags are in our house.
Jay,"Oh, then you were right. This is uncomfortable. This is uncomfortable."
Cameron,"Do you like it? The recipe called for a cup of water, but I used milk instead to make the sauce creamier."
Mitchell,"Cam, I need to tell you something."
Cameron,You hate it.
Mitchell,Cameron.
Cameron,No. You're right. I shouldn't try anything new ever.
Mitchell,"Stop it. I'm trying to talk to you. Okay, today, when we were leaving the mall, I saw Tracy by the fountain..."
Cameron,"Please, don't tell me you slept with her again. Did you? You didn't. Right? You're joking. Yeah."
Mitchell,"Okay. Um... I don't know how to say this, or... or if I'm even right. I'm probably not. But, um, she was with a redheaded boy, about 8 years old, which is the same number of years since we..."
Cameron,No!
Mitchell,"And she said she'd only been married a year, and it would explain why she was so awkward with me, and..."
Cameron,Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm-hmm.
Mitchell,No...
Cameron,Mm-hmm.
Mitchell,"I know. I know. It's crazy, but, Cam, I need to find out if he's mine."
Cameron,Mm.
Mitchell,Are you okay?
Cameron,"Yeah. Yeah, well, you don't just tell your partner you may have a baby with someone else and expect him to go back to eating a delicious and inventive meal like it's nothing! Mm-hmm."
Mitchell,"Okay, Cam, but even if he is mine, it doesn't change anything between us."
Cameron,"Mitchell, I need to have my reaction. Mm! Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."
Gloria,Jay! They order a cab. Are you happy now?
Jay,I'll be happy when I hear a trunk close.
Manny,"Hey, mom. You want a drink of water?"
Gloria,"No, papi. Not right now."
Manny,You sure? You look thirsty.
Gloria,What's with you and the water today?
Manny,It's a dribble cup. You can't drink from it without spilling. I think it's going to make me very popular.
Gloria,"Ay, papi, why do you need these things to make you popular? First the walking stick, then the business cards."
Jay,Are they gone yet?
Gloria,Why did you talk to them like that?
Jay,What? I was just being honest. They're boring as hell!
Gloria,Quiet! They can hear you!
Jay,"Oh, he probably already heard me. His hobby is listening."
Gloria,"Jay, you don't treat people like that."
Jay,What? I should do what you do? Pretend to like someone you don't?
Gloria,I'm doing it right now.
Jay,"Can I tell you something, Gloria? When you reach a certain age, you want to spend what precious little time you have left with people you actually like, not some bozos who glommed onto you."
Manny,Tell me about it. I've got a clingy fifth grader I can't shake.
Jay,"See, even Manny knows."
Manny,"I got your back, Jay. Thirsty?"
Gloria,"Manny, go to sleep."
Jay,Can we just please forget about this now?
Gloria,"And the worst thing is that you sold me out without warning and made me look like a fool. Husband and wife are supposed to help each other, not throw each other under the bus! I would never do that to you!"
Jay,"Gloria... Gloria, wait! Could you get my book for me? I left it downstairs."
Gloria,I am so sorry.
Gloria,"Ay, wait. You left this."
Gloria,Oh.
Gloria,That's amazing.
Gloria,"No, no. Don't go. I really want you to spend the night here."
Gloria,"Jay doesn't know what he wants. I don't like to tell this to people, but, uh... Jay's mind is... going away."
Gloria,"He's so old, some nights it's like... he's not even here."
Mitchell,Hey. You never came to bed.
Cameron,I fell asleep in the den.
Mitchell,"Cam, we need to talk about..."
Cameron,"Mitchell, wait. Listen. I was up all night, thinking about it. And here's the thing. If you would have told me 10 years ago that I would be living with someone and raising a beautiful baby girl, I would have said you were crazy. But here we are. And you and Lily are the best things that have ever happened to me. So if you're telling me there's another kid, how can that be anything but good?"
Mitchell,"Oh, Cam, that's... that means so..."
Cameron,"No, it's okay."
Mitchell,"No, I need to have my reaction."
Cameron,We're gonna be okay.
Mitchell,Yeah.
Cameron,So what do we do now?
Mitchell,I don't know. I guess I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna have to call Tracy and tell her that we need to talk. Okay. Um...
Cameron,Are you nervous?
Mitchell,"I'm terrified. Yes. I mean, what's this kid gonna think of me? I've been absent for the first eight years of his life. I mean, how do you make up for time like that when..."
Cameron,"Okay, slow down. You're spinning out. It's probably just a false alarm."
Mitchell,"No, you're right. This could be my ""going bald"" scare all over again."
Cameron,Yeah. And we know how that turned out.
Claire,Honey. What would happen if the greatest scientists on earth got together to mate nature's two most violent predators?
Phil,"Are we talking about ""Croctopus"" in 3-D?"
Claire,At 2:10.
Phil,Book it!
Phil,"Claire and I share a true love of cheesy cinema. Um, our favorite categories include genetically engineered animals gone wrong..."
Claire,Old and young people switching bodies.
Phil,"Mm. Uh, tough guys taking care of babies."
Claire,Any sequel three and higher.
Phil,"Oh, yeah. Usually get a new cast around five... That's where the magic really happens."
Claire,Yeah. Yeah.
Phil,Yeah.
Claire,"Mm! Hey, honey, how'd your test go?"
Alex,Second highest in the class.
Claire,"Hey. Well, that's great."
Alex,Sanjay Patel edged me out by 12 points.
Phil,"Oh, honey, who cares what she did?"
Alex,It's a he! Sanjay is a very common Indian boy's name. There are like millions of them.
Claire,"Sweetheart, it's still a great score. I hope you're not beating yourself up."
Alex,I'm not.
Phil,That's our girl.
Alex,Sanjay's dad's a surgeon. His mom's a professor. I can't compete with that. I'll just have to do the best I can with what I was given.
Phil,Good for you!
Claire,"We're proud of you, honey."
Phil,She's such a good kid.
Claire,"Yeah, she is. Did she just say she was gonna do the best with what she was given?"
Phil,"I don't know. I was still thinking about all the Sanjays. I don't know any, but I know three Miltons."
Claire,She's saying we're stupid!
Phil,"Well, she's... wrong."
Claire,"Is she? Honey, look at how long it just took us to figure out that she's insulting us. Are we holding our kids back?"
Phil,No. We're both bright people.
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,"We're college graduates. We read. I'd go so far as to say we're as intellectual and sophisticated as... Sweet! ""Croctopus"" tickets confirmed!"
Manny,"Hey, guys."
Gloria,Where are you going?
Jay,Got a golf lesson. My swing's a mess. Manny's coming with me.
Gloria,"No, you can't go downstairs now. You'll run into the Hoffmans."
Jay,"Actually, I want to talk to them, because I've been thinking about what you said last night, and I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. You're right. You never would have done that to me."
Gloria,I forgive you!
Jay,So I'll say goodbye.
Gloria,"No, Jay. Don't do that. First they think you like them. Then they think you don't like them. Don't confuse them."
Jay,I want to do this for you.
Gloria,"Jay, wait!"
Jay,It's okay.
Gloria,"Ay, Jay, wait!"
Manny,What do you mean?
Manny,A little? It's hard to watch.
Manny,"Well, he does swear a lot. You know, the worst is when he goes off into the woods. Oh, and when he drives... Oh, my God. Look out. I'm surprised he hasn't killed anybody yet!"
Jay,Hey! I'm so glad you guys are still here. I just want to say... sorry for last night.
Gloria,"Ay, you see? Problem is solved. Now go. You're going to be late."
Jay,"There's nothing wrong with you guys. You know, it's... it's me."
Jay,Now I'm confused.
Manny,"Uh, here, Jay. I poured you a glass of orange juice."
Jay,"Thanks, kid. What the hell? What's wrong with me?!"
Manny,It's always funny.
Gloria,"Jay, go change. I'll be there in one second."
Jay,"Well, at least let me drive you to the airport."
Claire,"Honey, do you want popcorn or anything?"
Phil,"No, I'm good...'N' plenty. So hold your water 'cause I've got some ""twix"" up my sleeve."
Claire,"You may be cool, but I'm... wine cooler."
Phil,I love us. Thank you.
Claire,Hey!
Phil,Hey! Who is that?
Claire,"It's the Patels, Sanjay's parents."
Claire,I heard Sanjay did so well on his test today.
Claire,Wow. Indeed. Yeah. Yeah.
Claire,"Well, we're not here to see ""Croctopus""!"
Phil,"Well, that makes ""deux"" of us."
Phil,All right.
Claire,You bet.
Phil,See you in there!
Claire,"Phil, where are you going?!"
Phil,"""Croctopus""."
Claire,Honey. Honey! I think we should go see this movie.
Phil,Why do I have to watch a French movie? I didn't do anything wrong.
Claire,"Well, maybe Alex has a point. How can we encourage our kids to have intellectual curiosity when we don't have any?"
Phil,I don't know. It's two hours of our life. Fine. For our kids. Sometimes I hate the kids.
Claire,I know.
Phil,I'm so confused.
Claire,I'm not. I love this.
Phil,You do not. Name one thing you've liked about this.
Claire,I liked the scene with the old man on the beach.
Phil,That was a trailer for a different movie.
Claire,So he's not coming back?
Phil,"No, he's not coming back, and I'm not coming back, either!"
Claire,Some of us are trying to enjoy this film.
Phil,"While Claire watched one of the most highly acclaimed films of the year, I sat through a badly made schlockfest with absolutely no redeeming value. And it was awesome."
Phil,"Oh, my God. It feels like I have ink on me!"
Phil,"Sweetheart... Hey. Hey, hey, hey."
Claire,What?
Phil,Honey...
Claire,"Oh, my God. I fell asleep. I missed it."
Phil,"Yeah, let's go home."
Claire,I can't believe I fell asleep and you left. Alex is right... we're idiots.
Phil,"Claire, stop it. Look... Our kid got the second-best grade in the class. Dumb parents don't make kids that smart. She got the best of both of us."
Claire,Mm.
Phil,Kind of like if you combined the jaw strength of a crocodile and the ink-spraying capabilities of an octopus. You'd end up with something unstoppable.
Claire,"But they did stop him in the end, didn't they?"
Phil,"""Her"". And she laid eggs."
Claire,Croctopi.
Phil,Yeah.
Claire,Ohh.
Phil,Hey. Hey. Check out Einstein over there.
Claire,"Well, that's just sad. Hey, Vish. You just do this."
Claire,Not in the least.
Phil,I actually found it quite two-dimensional.
Claire,Hmm.
Phil,"Hmm. Well, lovely to see you."
Phil,All right.
Phil,"Bye. After you, doctor."
Claire,"After you, professor."
Mitchell,"Hi. Um, so... W... we need to talk."
Mitchell,Do you mind if we sit down?
Mitchell,"Um, Tracy, I... I have something to say, and I'm afraid that if I just don't say it all at once, I'm never gonna say it. So..."
Mitchell,"Again... sorry about that. Anyway, uh, I saw you yesterday across the mall after we spoke and couldn't help but notice that you weren't alone. Uh, you were with... I don't even know how to put this."
Mitchell,Bobby. Cameron ; Such a lovely name.
Mitchell,Tracy... I... is he...?
Mitchell,"Oh, my God. Oh... Okay. Um... Why didn't you tell me?"
Mitchell,"I... I was freaked out, Tracy, and I..."
Cameron,"Hey, let's not rehash the past... but rather, focus on the future."
Mitchell,"Yes, yes. Yes, Cam and I, um, want to know if you're open... to us... getting to know Bobby."
Mitchell,"Okay, I understand. No, it might be a little awkward at first, but I think after some time..."
Cameron,We brought him a present.
Mitchell,"Please, we just... we really just want to meet him."
Mitchell,"Hey, what's up, dude?"
Mitchell,Good. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Hi. Cameron.
Mitchell,"Um, uh, how... uh, we, um..."
Cameron,The prom.
Mitchell,Oh... it's not...
Cameron,You don't need to...
Mitchell,I wouldn't even...
Cameron,You don't...
Cameron,I'm just gonna go and let you two catch up.
Mitchell,So... 'Sup?
Jay,I never realized that you ever had sex with a girl.
Mitchell,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I kind of got around back then, actually."
Jay,More than one?
Mitchell,Please.
Jay,"Well, there was Tracy. Who else?"
Mitchell,"Uh, Betty Rizzo."
Jay,Don't remember her.
Mitchell,Eliza Doolittle? Nellie Forbush?
Jay,These were classmates?
Mitchell,"Well, s... s... some were older. S... some were younger. Uh, Liesel and Gretel Von Trapp. Sisters, obviously... too far?"
Jay,I'm not an idiot. You played that record night and day. Why would you tell me a thing like that?
Mitchell,I just...
Jay,Come on! Let's go! We're gonna need a little extra time at airport security 'cause I'm pretty sure they're gonna want to patch you down.
Gloria,"Manny's with his father for the weekend, so Jay and I are flying to Vegas."
Jay,"I'm a little torn because I want alone time with Gloria, but I also like rubbing Manny's head for good luck."
Gloria,"I just need to send this e-mail to Claire why I'm not working on the bake sale next week, but I can't say the real reason."
Jay,Why not?
Gloria,Because she drives me crazy when she's in charge of these things.
Jay,"Okay. We got a flight to catch, so let me help you out here. Okay. You tell me what you want to say to her, and I'll help you find a nice way to say it."
Gloria,I want to say... I can't work on the bake sale because you're a bossy control freak that looks down on my cupcakes even though your lemon squares were very dry.
Jay,Done. Okay? How's this?
Gloria,"""Dear Claire, I can't work the bake sale because you're a bossy control freak who look down..."" Very funny, Jay. Ay... ay... why the whoosh? Where is... where is the e-mail? It sended! Ay. Make it come back."
Jay,I don't know how to make it come back.
Gloria,"Now she's gonna read it, and she's gonna think it's from me!"
Jay,"Well, technically, it was from you. But come on, let's hit the road."
Gloria,It sended. Please come back.
Mitchell,"We love our neighborhood, but sometimes the last thing you want to do after fighting traffic is get back in the car to go out to eat. And the only restaurant within walking distance is Shawarma City."
Cameron,"Uh, one meat. One chicken."
Mitchell,And can you make the chicken all white meat?
Mitchell,"Okay, that's not an answer."
Mitchell,"Then a miracle happened. Uh, the hottest new restaurant in the city opened up two blocks away... Amelia's."
Cameron,But there was a problem.
Mitchell,They can take us at 5:15...
Cameron,"What are we, 80?"
Mitchell,Or 10:45.
Cameron,"What are we, 20?"
Cameron,Then... miracle number two. Turns out one of the mothers at Lily's pre-school is none other than Amelia herself.
Mitchell,"So we arranged a play date with her son, Jackson, where we would, you know, charm Amelia."
Mitchell,"Okay. The most important play date ever, so I'm really gonna need you to sparkle, sweetie."
Cameron,"Oh, I'm gonna sparkle like it's the 4th of July."
Mitchell,I was talking to Lily.
Alex,"It's our parents' anniversary, so we're surprising them with breakfast in bed."
Haley,They're impossible to buy for... we think. We've never really tried.
Alex,"Okay. Ready? One, two, three..."
Phil,Oh. Oh! No! No!
Claire,I'm sorry!
Phil,Nothing's happening!
Claire,"Oh, my God."
Phil,"Yeah, our kids walked in on us. We were, as they say, ""having sex""."
Claire,"Oh, God. That's not a euphemism, Phil. It's exactly what we were doing... having sex. In front of our children."
Phil,"Well, they weren't there when we started."
Claire,No.
Phil,"In fact, you weren't even there when we sta..."
Claire,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
Phil,It's okay. Maybe they didn't see anything.
Claire,"Sweetie, t... they screamed, they dropped a tray of dishes, and then they ran out of here like they were on fire."
Phil,"You were on fire, lady."
Claire,Really? You're still going?
Phil,"Well, forgive me for thinking your zesty performance deserves some praise."
Claire,"Phil, our children are downstairs right now, and they are probably traumatized."
Phil,"Oh, come on. I'm sure it's not that bad."
Alex,I can still see it!
Haley,I can't believe that just happened!
Luke,What were they doing?
Alex,Nothing!
Luke,"Whatever it was, it looked like dad was winning."
Haley,It! They were doing it!
Alex,He has no idea what you're taking about.
Luke,Sex?
Alex,Yes!
Luke,"I know what sex is, Alex. It's when a man and a woman take off their underpants and then get into the bed."
Alex,Stop talking!
Haley,Aah!
Gloria,Try Claire again.
Jay,"I'm not getting a signal. Relax. We'll get her. Hey, shorty told me about this restaurant in Vegas that's got a three-story wine tower right in the middle of it. The guy who gets your wine flies around on a wire."
Gloria,"Like the ""Peter Pan""."
Jay,"No. Not like the ""Peter Pan"". This is a high-end place."
Gloria,"Oh, yeah, because all the finest restaurants in the world have people flying around on wires."
Jay,"You know, you used to go bananas when a Japanese guy flipped a shrimp onto your plate. Now look at you."
Gloria,Try her again.
Jay,"Fine. And just so you know, it's not like Peter Pan. I mean, nobody wears tights or anything."
Gloria,"Well, if they're not wearing anything, I don't want them flying over my food."
Phil,Hello.
Jay,"Phil, it's me. Can I talk to Claire?"
Phil,"Yeah. One second, Jay. It's your dad."
Claire,"No. No, no. Can't. Unh-unh."
Phil,She doesn't want to talk right now.
Gloria,"Ay, no."
Jay,Why not?
Phil,"Uh, she's a little too upset."
Jay,"Phil, put her on."
Phil,He says he wants to...
Claire,: Hang up the phone.
Phil,"I'm sorry, Jay. She says I have to go."
Jay,"You know, she's my daughter and everything, but that guy seriously needs to grow a pair. Well, we tried. Vegas, here we come."
Gloria,Turn around the car.
Jay,Only 'cause I want to.
Cameron,This is a... a beautiful home. I love the throwback to the '60s.
Mitchell,"Although if this was the '60s, we'd be a couple of ""Confirmed bachelors,"" and Lily would be a yorkie."
Mitchell,"Oh, Amelia."
Cameron,"Oh, you are funny! Oh!"
Cameron,"Now, what do you do, Amelia?"
Cameron,"Oh, my gosh. Are you that Amelia?"
Mitchell,Can't get in. Can't.
Cameron,"Oh, I'm sorry. Tell them what?"
Cameron,Oh.
Cameron,"Yeah. You said to tell them s... something. Did you hear that? When we know what to say, we're in."
Mitchell,"Oh! This is very exciting. I've never had an in at a restaurant before. They'll probably greet us at the door by our names, show us to our favorite table..."
Cameron,"They'll let us play fast and loose with the menu, order lunch things for dinner, dinner things for lunch! It's fine. It's fine. It's fine."
Mitchell,Cameron!
Cameron,It's fine.
Mitchell,Stop moving.
Cameron,"Oh, that's the baby monitor. Should we turn it off?"
Mitchell,"Okay, this is why she's so successful. She's tough but calm."
Mitchell,Act like you weren't listening.
Cameron,What does that look like?
Mitchell,"Oh, it's not a problem. We'll watch the kids."
Cameron,"Oh, yes, you go take care of that fabulous restaurant of yours that we cannot wait to try. And when we do call, Amelia, you said to..."
Mitchell,Did you hear that?
Cameron,She owes us big time.
Mitchell,"You know, she also has that restaurant in Las Vegas where the sommeliers fly around on wires."
Cameron,"Oh, my gosh. Lily, thank you for being such a trouper with Mr. Personality over there. I'm gonna get you a treat. Oh, a juice box broke in here. It's all wet inside. Will you stop gasping? It's just a diaper..."
Claire,Okay. We need a game plan. We need to rehearse exactly what we're gonna say because that is the only way I'm gonna hold it together when my babies are looking at me with judgment and disgust.
Phil,"First of all, that's how they always look at us."
Claire,"Oh, Phil."
Phil,"Secondly, this isn't as traumatic as you think."
Claire,"Honey, I walked in on my parents having sex once. It was... oh... awful. I can't even get the image out of my mind."
Phil,"Claire, we're not your parents. We're in much better shape."
Claire,"Okay. You want to know the worst thing? They didn't even talk about it. They just let it hang there. I'm not gonna do that to our kids. Phil, this... this is a defining moment for us as parents. How we handle this could shape how they feel about sex and intimacy for the rest of their lives!"
Phil,"Claire. Honey. Honey, this is only a big deal if we make it a big deal. We set the tone here. So let's just play it cool. Act like it was a big, funny mix-up. Crack a few jokes. Lighten the mood."
Claire,Jokes.
Phil,Yeah.
Claire,What kind of jokes?
Phil,"Well, this is... I'm just spitballin' here, but... what if I was all, ""knock, knock""... and they were like, ""who's there?"" And I was all, ""someone who doesn't want to see their parents doing it. That's why we knocked"". Again, this is... this is very rough."
Haley,Why are they still up there?
Luke,Yeah. How long does sex take?
Alex,"Oh, my God. Stop talking."
Luke,Did you guys notice that dad had the same look on his face as when he smells a new car?
Alex,I need to leave. I need to go to camp.
Haley,This is gonna be so weird when they come down. Let's just go. Okay? Come on.
Luke,Wait. But I'm hungry.
Haley,We'll get breakfast. Let's just go. Come on! Let's go. Come on.
Jay,Where are you going?
Haley,Anywhere.
Gloria,Where is your mother? I need to talk to her.
Haley,I don't think it's a good time right now. She won't come out of her room.
Gloria,"She's really upset, isn't she?"
Haley,Big time.
Alex,How'd you know?
Jay,We called.
Gloria,Tell me exactly what she said.
Luke,I don't know. There was just a lot of screaming.
Jay,Where was your father when all this was going on?
Luke,"Oh, he was right behind her."
Alex,Ugh! Ugh!
Cameron,Oh! It's not coming out! It's not coming out!
Mitchell,Blot! Don't rub! Blot!
Cameron,We are beyond blotting and rubbing. I think we've moved on to sweating and crying.
Mitchell,"Okay, okay. Let's not panic. We'll just... we'll tell Amelia what happened, and then we'll pay to have it cleaned."
Cameron,"What if it can't be cleaned, Mitchell?!"
Mitchell,"Okay, okay. Then we'll pay for a new rug."
Mitchell,Anjelica Huston!
Mitchell,"Oh! Oh, my God. $50,000 for a rug?! Cam, we don't have that kind of money."
Cameron,"Maybe she won't make us pay. I mean, we wouldn't make someone pay if this happened to us."
Mitchell,"Did you not hear her on the phone? ""Fix it. Replace it. Write me a check"". She probably has that embroidered on a pillow, right next to a jar of human tears."
Cameron,Maybe we can turn this around.
Mitchell,How? It looks like someone bled out over here.
Cameron,"No. I mean the rug. Maybe we can turn the whole rug around, put it under the couch. See? No one would ever know it's there."
Mitchell,"Well, you know, we would know."
Cameron,Well...
Mitchell,What are you thinking?
Cameron,You don't want to know.
Mitchell,"No, tell me, 'cause I'm... I think I'm thinking the same thing."
Cameron,"I seriously doubt that, because now I'm thinking it was Joan Collins' house."
Phil,"Gloria, what are you... what are you doing here?"
Claire,"Wait, where are the kids?"
Gloria,They just left. They told me that you were very upset.
Claire,"Oh, God."
Gloria,And you have every right to be.
Claire,It was bad.
Gloria,"I know that. Claire, it was an accident."
Claire,That doesn't make it any better.
Gloria,"Okay, you're right. I know how you feel."
Claire,"Oh, God."
Gloria,"It happened to me before, with another woman. And that time, I was the one getting it. And it hurt."
Phil,Wow.
Gloria,"I'm sorry it had to come out like this, but you have to admit that you're only happy when you're the one cracking the whip."
Claire,"What? Gloria Come on, we all know how you ride Phil. But maybe if you just let go a little, maybe even taste my cupcakes, I will join you."
Claire,No... unh-unh. No. No. I... I am so confused right now.
Phil,I may pass out.
Claire,What are you talking about?
Gloria,What are you talking about?
Claire,The kids just walked in on me and Phil i... in bed. And we've just spent the last hour holed up in our room trying to figure out what to say to them.
Gloria,Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Can I use your computer? I just need to check one e-mail.
Claire,"Yeah, the kitchen."
Jay,"Gloria, I just switched us to the next flight. Now, did you guys get everything straightened out?"
Gloria,Claire is very upset because the kids just walk in on them having sex.
Jay,"Aw, geez."
Claire,"Oh, then we're all up to speed."
Gloria,She's so upset that she hasn't even had time to apply her make-up or use her computer.
Claire,"W... what are you even doing here, dad?"
Jay,"I don't think you should be the one doing the questioning here, missy."
Phil,Don't get mad at her. Your wife's the one who just offered up her cupcakes.
Claire,Phil.
Luke,Good thing we had mom's gas card.
Haley,"Don't make me regret buying you that lighter, dude. Put it down."
Alex,"Okay, I'm just gonna say it. Our parents are totally irresponsible. And I'm not just talking about us walking in on their... little freak show earlier."
Haley,Just let it go.
Alex,No. We're lucky to be alive. How often do they let Luke go... go to school in shorts in the winter? And they let me ride in the front seat before I was 60 pounds. And they never shut the gate at the top of the stairs when we were babies. Do you know how many times you fell on your head? Do you?
Luke,No.
Haley,"We get it... it was bad. But, you know, I... I guess... It's better than having parents who fight all the time. Maybe."
Luke,My friend Jacob's parents are getting divorced. He has to move out of his house. They told him last week.
Alex,That sucks.
Haley,He'll get used to it. Half of my friends' parents are divorced.
Alex,Mine too.
Haley,It's insane.
Luke,So it's a good thing mom and dad still do sex.
Alex,"Better than mom leaving the stove on, which she's done twice this month."
Haley,I just realized we haven't even gotten to the worst part of it yet.
Alex,Which is?
Haley,They're gonna want to talk about it.
Luke,"Well, maybe not."
Alex,"Are you kidding? Their parents never talked about anything, so they want to talk about everything."
Haley,"Yeah, they called a family meeting when we switched to 1% milk."
Claire,I don't know where those kids are.
Jay,What is more important than putting a working lock on a bedroom door?
Claire,You are one to talk.
Jay,What is that supposed to mean?
Claire,You don't remember when I walked in on you and mom that time?
Jay,"Gloria, can we please go now?!"
Claire,"Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm. So why don't you just get off your high horse, dad. At least I am trying to handle this better than the two of you did."
Jay,What did we do?
Claire,You made gimlets and went back to your room.
Jay,What were we supposed to do?
Claire,You... you... you could have talked to me. You could have made sure that I was okay.
Jay,Want to talk about it?
Claire,Yes.
Jay,"Fine. Your mother and I were watching a particularly racy episode of ""Hart to Hart"". Stefanie powers had to go undercover as a call girl."
Claire,Mnh-mnh. Dad.
Jay,Hang on. This whole story makes more sense if you know I got a thing for thigh-high boots.
Claire,"Oh, gross! Gross. You are ruining sex for me. And boots."
Phil,Hey. Working okay for you?
Gloria,"Oh, yes. I was sending an e-mail to my brother in Colombia."
Phil,Oh.
Gloria,"Um, I was telling him about Claire. You know, I realize there's so much I don't know about her. Like, for example, what is her favorite word? Or what was her first pet's name?"
Phil,"Gloria, I'm not an idiot. Are you trying to get Claire's password?"
Gloria,"Okay, fine. I sent her something by mistake. I need to get into Claire's e-mail to erase it before she sees it."
Claire,Before I see what?
Gloria,"Hola, Claire."
Claire,"Hi, Gloria. Before I see what?"
Gloria,"It's so embarrassing. You see, Jay and I..."
Jay,It's a naked picture of Gloria.
Phil,Whoa.
Gloria,Yes. Naked.
Claire,Mm.
Gloria,I was gonna send it to Jay. You see everything. The whole body.
Phil,I need to sit.
Claire,"Okay. Wow, dad. So, you just got done giving me a lecture on the importance of locking my bedroom door while in my house to retrieve naked pictures that your wife accidentally sent me."
Jay,The irony is just occurring to me.
Claire,Mm. Mm.
Gloria,What are you doing?
Claire,What I'm doing... is deleting it.
Jay,Good for you. Let's go to Vegas!
Gloria,Ciao!
Claire,"Do us a favor... no pictures. Oh, Gloria, listen. We do need to talk about the bake sale at some point. I have some concerns."
Gloria,Of course you do.
Claire,Yes.
Jay,Bye-bye!
Claire,What do we do now?
Phil,"Okay, I'm really afraid of reading this situation the wrong way, but I'm 80% sure you're coming on to me. Okay, now... 40%."
Cameron,"Mitchell, we need to make a decision."
Mitchell,"It was the perfect plan. Turn the rug, and she wouldn't find the stain for years."
Cameron,But we couldn't do it. We're too honest.
Mitchell,"There are certain moments in life that define you, and this is one of those moments."
Mitchell,Jackson did it.
Cameron,He grabbed Lily's strawberry juice and started drinking it.
Mitchell,"Before we could stop him, it was all over everything."
Mitchell,We are horrible people.
Cameron,I'm only following your lead.
Mitchell,"Yeah, so close that you stepped on the back of my shoe."
Mitchell,What?
Cameron,Oh! Are you sure?
Mitchell,He seems all right to me.
Cameron,"Yeah, maybe just get him some fresh air."
Mitchell,You know what?
Mitchell,Amelia...
Cameron,Oh!
Mitchell,Wait!
Cameron,Wait! Jackson didn't drink the juice! I stepped on Lily's bag and a juice box fell and we panicked because we heard you on the phone and we can't afford Joan Collins' rug!
Mitchell,"We are so, so sorry. We could not feel any worse."
Mitchell,Yeah. Yeah.
Mitchell,"Oh, uh, can we have some napkins, please?"
Cameron,He knows your name!
Claire,"And, uh... I'm just gonna say it... I'm really sorry about what happened."
Phil,"Well, we're... we're not sorry about what happened. We're sorry that you saw what happened."
Claire,"Yeah, okay. They... they get that. Let's see. Uh, no one wants to see their parents... Shhh..."
Phil,Your sensuality...
Claire,...not dressed. Oh.
Phil,"Basically, it's two adults."
Claire,Adults.
Phil,It's like you're shaking hands.
Claire,Mm-Hmm.
Phil,But you're not using your hands at all.
Alex,I can't handle a big family talk about this.
Haley,"We're not gonna have a choice. So when they start talking, just smile and nod and think about something else."
Luke,"Yeah, it's easy. Just like at school."
Haley,Yeah.
Claire,"So, I... I guess what I'm saying here is that as you get older and... explore your sexuality, you will discover that as long as you are in a committed relationship with consenting adults, there's really nothing to be embarrassed about."
Phil,And let's face it... your mom can't keep her hands off me whenever the gun show comes to town.
Luke,"Good one, dad."
Alex,Humor makes difficult situations easier!
Claire,Wow. Really?
Haley,Totally. You talked to us on our level but without being condescending!
Claire,We did.
Phil,All right. I guess we did.
Claire,"Ha! Yay, us. I think we really handled that well."
Phil,Me too. You were excellent.
Claire,You were pretty good.
Phil,Ohhh. Wow.
Claire,"Ugh, this is such a weird day."
Phil,I know it.
Claire,By the way... happy anniversary.
Phil,It always is. Mmm.
Haley,"Hey mom, can I get... oh, my God! Enough!"
Claire,"Hey, what's this?"
Haley,Your anniversary present.
Phil,Aww.
Claire,That's very sweet.
Phil,My goodness.
Claire,What is it? A door lock. How embarrassing. Thank you.
Phil,We'll use it all the time.
Claire,Mm.
Haley,We thought the lock was a really good idea.
Alex,But the problem is... it makes a noise.
Luke,A loud noise.
Alex,Ugh!
Luke,It's hard for me to look at dad afterwards.
Claire,"So, honey, Ibiza can only take us at 6:30 tonight."
Phil,Great. I will meet you at Ibiza.
Alex,": It's pronounced ""Ibeetha,"" not ""Ibeeza."""
Phil,"Oh, thanks, honey. That reminds me... this weekend, I want to see that baby panda at the ""thoo. """
Alex,Yeah... I'm the idiot.
Claire,"This year for Valentine's Day, we're gonna have a nice, quiet dinner at Ibiza. Last year, we, um... We overreached... A little."
Phil,We created sexy alter egos... Clive and Juliana... met in the hotel bar. This one lost her panties in the lobby in front of her dad... Which was hil... it was hard. It was hard for her.
Claire,You know I can't stand it when you use that word.
Phil,"""Panties""?"
Claire,Yeah... that. Yes. That word.
Phil,Sorry. She lost her underpanties.
Cameron,So?
Mitchell,So?
Cameron,Well? So?
Mitchell,What's happening?
Cameron,Flowers?
Mitchell,Is someone pointing a gun at you?
Cameron,"Oh, for goodness' sake. Did you get the flowers Lily and I sent you?"
Mitchell,"Oh, that's so sweet. No. No, I didn't get anything."
Cameron,Really? Did you check with that assistant of yours?
Mitchell,"Broderick! Uh, did you get any flowers today?"
Cameron,"No, for Mitchell! The flowers are for Mitchell!"
Cameron,Mitchell's assistant has a huge crush on him.
Mitchell,He does not.
Cameron,"And I think the only prudent thing to do is say, ""you're fired. """
Mitchell,Don't be jealous. He just looks up to me.
Cameron,The thing about Mitchell is he can be naive. He is completely unaware of how absolutely adorable he is.
Mitchell,"Oh. Okay, well, thank you. But I am aware when someone has a crush on me, and he does not have a crush on me."
Claire,I was a little concerned when they said they could only
Phil,"I know. This house is on fire, right? Now, this is how you do V-Day."
Claire,Except most of these people could have been here on V-e Day.
Phil,"But it's classy, which we deserve."
Claire,"Yes, we do."
Phil,"What were we thinking last year, acting like a couple of teenagers?"
Claire,I know. Oh!
Phil,"Hey, we've had our crazy Valentine's Days. We tore it up! But you got to know when to let that stuff go."
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,All those kids out there are just looking for something that we've already got.
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,I love you.
Claire,"I love you, too."
Phil,"Oh, my gosh!"
Claire,Wow!
Phil,I'm good. We're good.
Claire,Are you all right?
Phil,"Oh, hey, let me... let me help you out. How about I park it over there for you, okay?"
Phil,"Here's your valet ticket. I'm kidding, actually. That's my valet ticket. All right. Let's see. Lefty loosey, righty tighty. Hey! All right. This is fun, Claire. You got to try this."
Claire,Phil.
Claire,I know Phil and I are gonna grow old together someday...
Phil,This thing needs mirrors.
Claire,But today is not that day.
Claire,"Hello? Hello, may I speak to Clive?"
Phil,I'm sorry. I think you have the wrong number. Bye-bye.
Claire,"I got disconnected. Would you mind redialing? Hello? Hello, Clive. This is Juliana."
Phil,"Look lady, please stop calling me. This is..."
Claire,No. Phil. Phil. Phil. Don't hang up.
Phil,Claire?
Claire,"No, no, no. Not Claire. Juliana. And you're Clive Bixby, remember? We met at the hotel bar last year. Now... Make up some lie, ditch that wife of yours, and meet me at our hotel in 30 minutes. You think you can you manage that?"
Phil,"Baby doll, I've been lying to my wife for 16 years."
Claire,Okay. See ya. So... Champagne?
Phil,"Um, actually, Claire, something's come up. So... Gotta go."
Claire,You're not ditching me here on Valentine's Day. Screw that. Sit.
Phil,But... O... okay. We'll... we'll stay.
Claire,Phil.
Phil,"Oh, that's part of it? So hot! Claire. I'm leaving. Deal with it. So, no one walks anymore!"
Jay,Should be just few more minutes.
Gloria,When is our reservation?
Jay,Here's the thing.
Gloria,"Ay, no, not ""the thing. "" I hate ""the thing. """
Jay,My secretary screwed up and didn't get us one. Don't worry. I'll slip the guy a few bucks.
Jay,"What kind of idiot messes up two Valentine's in a row? Not this idiot. Two months ago, I booked a private chef, musicians - the works... for a romantic dinner at home. I just had to get the señorita out of the house while they set up."
Jay,This is 50 bucks. Do not give us a table.
Jay,You also must refuse my wife. She's very persuasive. Just a couple more minutes.
Jay,"So we don't get the table at the fancy restaurant, which drives Gloria crazy. ""Jay, why you not be no more romantic to me?"" We walk in the door, and bam! She looks like a big idiot. And isn't that what Valentine's Day is all about?"
Gloria,"Jay, come here. We're in. Your secretary didn't forget. Look. Pritchett for two."
Alex,"Just a reminder. I need the television at 8:00. Jeremy and I have a phone date to watch ""Love Actually. """
Haley,"That's the lamest plan ever, and I'm jealous."
Haley,"So, my boyfriend, David, blows me off on the most romantic night of the year... to study! This is the worst Valentine's Day."
Manny,"Best Valentine's Day ever! David stands up Haley, and old boyfriend Dylan is out of the picture."
Haley,"I'm not saying I miss Dylan, but at least he was romantic. David never sent me a jar of his own tears."
Manny,"I'm playing the long game here. Like me today, love me tomorrow. She's had the romantic. She's had the intellectual. How about all of that in one fine, little brown package?"
Haley,I've hit a new low.
Manny,You can talk to me.
Haley,And I'm lower.
Phil,"Just picking up some things. I am not here. Name tags, name tags, name tags. Come on! Bingo!"
Haley,"I know what to do. Dylan's been texting me again. I Bet if David knew that, he'd come running right over here."
Manny,"Wait. Before you start playing these games, let me ask you one simple question... Who is Haley Dunphy? Don't do it, Haley!"
Haley,Stop following me.
Manny,"Let me just say my piece. Look, you can be the Haley who defines herself as David's girlfriend, or Dylan's girlfriend, or you can be your own Haley. Maybe you haven't met her, but I know her. She's an amazing person. So when you're ready, I'd like to introduce you."
Cameron,No. I just came by to pick up my man. I'm taking him to Ibiza tonight.
Cameron,On Valentine's night?
Cameron,Gasp. I'm shocked.
Cameron,"Oh, aren't you a dear? I'd like to mount your head in my trophy room."
Cameron,"Oh, please. Let's not play this game. We both know what's going on."
Cameron,"Uh, the flowers that don't get delivered, the Valentine's Day plans that get interrupted... Do I really need to spell it out for you? Me, Mitchell, wedge."
Cameron,"Does Broderick have a crush? Yes. On someone he frequently sees at the office? Yes. Does that man have red hair and a beard? No, but his boyfriend does. It's me. The... the crush is on me."
Cameron,"Oh, yes."
Phil,Appletini?
Claire,"It was. You're looking handsome as ever, Clive."
Phil,"As are you, Juliana. You are hot enough to cook a pizza on... in."
Claire,I see the speaker business is treating you well.
Phil,"I don't like to talk about money... but I have exactly $10 million... minus the cost of your next drink. Two. Just two appletinis, please. Thank you so much. Yeah..."
Claire,Why do I get the feeling you're not really a salesman?
Phil,"Ohh... Pretty and smart. Or should I say ""pretty smart""? I might do some high-risk work for Uncle Sam that takes me clear around the country."
Claire,"Mm, so you could say you're a... national man of mystery."
Phil,Never did catch what you do.
Claire,Didn't you?
Phil,"Surprising, I know. I'm usually pretty goo at catching things from women in bars."
Claire,"Well... Clive, I am just a bored housewife with a dark side and an hour to kill."
Phil,Is that what I think it is?
Claire,"It's not a gift card. Or maybe it is. I'll be upstairs, Clive. Don't take too long."
Phil,I never do.
Gloria,"Jay, relax."
Jay,I'm sorry. The place is a dump.
Gloria,It's beautiful.
Jay,Nothing good on the menu. You see the hands on our waiter? Looks like he's been birthing hogs. Let's just get out of here.
Gloria,"I don't know what's wrong with you tonight, but I'm hungry, I look fantastic, we're staying."
Jay,"Five-course dinner waiting at home, and she's strapping on the feed bag at Ibiza. But then an angel from heaven saved the night."
Cameron,"You took our reservation! ""Pritchett for two"" is us. Come on, let's go! Move your bottom. Come on. Come on."
Jay,A big gay angelHello.
Claire,"Hello, Clive. How close are you?"
Phil,I am right outside your door.
Claire,Oh. Are you ready?
Phil,"Oh, I'm ready."
Claire,"I don't think you are, because I can still hear your pants."
Phil,"Well, maybe I should just shut them up."
Claire,I'll be out in a minute.
Phil,So... Will... I. Juliana?
Claire,"Clive, where are you?"
Phil,You have to come find me.
Claire,"Hello? Clive, I give up. Where are you?"
Phil,I'm right here on the bed.
Claire,"Phil, what room are you in?"
Phil,"Who's this ""Phil""?"
Claire,"Seriously, what room are you in?"
Phil,I'm in... 702.
Claire,I'm in 226.
Phil,"What?! Well, w-whose room is this, then? There's been a tiny mistake."
Cameron,"By the way, I need to apologize to you, I'm sorry I got so silly with all that Broderick stuff earlier."
Mitchell,"Oh, please, do not worry about it. Cam, I like it when you get a little jealous. Cut it out. As long as we can agree... he does not have a crush on me."
Cameron,"Absolutely. So, to us."
Mitchell,To us.
Cameron,He does not have a crush on you.
Mitchell,No.
Cameron,Nope.
Mitchell,Why do I feel like you're hinting at something?
Cameron,"Mitchell, we have talked long enough about Broderick's crush, which he does not have... on you."
Mitchell,"Oh, my God, what?"
Cameron,"Okay, fine. Since you won't let it go... your assistant is hot for me. That's why he's been playing the saboteur."
Mitchell,And you're sure it's not because he wants me?
Cameron,You just said he didn't.
Mitchell,"Well, I was protecting your feelings."
Cameron,He hugged me in the elevator.
Mitchell,"Well, pick out China and move to Vermont."
Cameron,He said it kills him to see someone else have something he wants.
Mitchell,Yes. Yes. You're the someone and I'm the something.
Cameron,Okay. All right. Call him.
Mitchell,Call him?
Cameron,Call him.
Mitchell,Why don't we just go over to his house and stand on opposite sides of the room and see which one of us he runs to?
Cameron,You get the check. I'll get the car.
Mitchell,"We are not going over there. And we're not calling him. Cam, who cares which one of us he has a crush on? The important thing is, I have a crush on you. And I wouldn't blame Broderick if he did, too."
Cameron,"That's so sweet. I... I wouldn't blame him if he had a crush on you, either."
Mitchell,Good.
Cameron,"""Good"" what?"
Mitchell,"Just, good."
Mitchell,"Oh, Cam! The second one."
Jay,Would you please just come in the house?!
Gloria,"You had a whole year to plan, but you don't make an effort. I am the second wife, Jay. Why do you treat me like I'm the first?"
Jay,Look about it inside. Where are you going?
Gloria,I'm gonna take a ride. I need to cool down.
Jay,Just come in the house. I promise you'll feel better.
Gloria,I don't want to go in there.
Jay,You're gonna like it better inside.
Gloria,Don't hold me back.
Jay,"I'm sorry about this, honey. I'm sorry."
Gloria,"Jay, what are you doing? Are you crazy?! What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?"
Jay,"No, but you're about to. Happy Valentine's Day! What the hell? Gloria! Honey."
Gloria,I'm going for a drive.
Jay,I had a whole private dinner planned. I don't know what happened.
Gloria,But I do. I know exactly what happened!
Jay,"No, you don't. What the hell?"
Gloria,"I win! I see you sneaking around, trying to trick me, so when I figure it out, I move the party over here, and I trick you. I win!"
Jay,"What do you mean, you win?"
Gloria,"I know you think I think you're not romantic, but I think you think I'm not smarter than you. So now we know. You are romantic, and I'm smarter than you. And I bought you a motorcycle."
Jay,"Oh, my God. It's fantastic."
Gloria,I win again!
Jay,"Honey, I love all this, but you can't win Valentine's Day. I mean, you defeat the whole idea if you make it into some silly competition."
Gloria,Shut up. I win.
Cameron,Let's go.
Mitchell,So we're really doing this?
Cameron,"Oh, we're doing this."
Mitchell,"Well, it's gonna be me."
Cameron,I'm already embarrassed for you.
Mitchell,"All right. Oh, wait."
Cameron,What?
Mitchell,"Oh, it's a text from Broderick."
Cameron,Read it.
Mitchell,"""Mitchell, by now I'm sure Cameron has told you what happened in the elevator. While I meant every word I said, I realize how unprofessional I was. Please accept my resignation. What you have with Cam is very special, and I would never forgive myself if I came between you. Treasure each other. Sincerely, Broderick."" Oh, Cam, what are we doing here?"
Cameron,"I don't know. Maybe if some assistant's crush is so important to us, it means we should appreciate each other a little bit more."
Mitchell,"Well, I can't think of a better time to start. Come here. Oh... And the great thing about that text is we don't have to know which one of us he wanted."
Mitchell,I know.
Cameron,I know.
Cameron,I know.
Claire,What are you doing?
Phil,"Valentine's Day isn't over yet, Juliana."
Claire,"Sweetie, let's not push it. You almost got arrested tonight."
Phil,That's how it's gonna be? You're just giving upon?
Claire,I am not giving up on us. I am giving up on Clive and Juliana.
Phil,"Wait. wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know a couple people who could possibly save this night. Maybe you've heard of them... ""Two American kids, doing the best that they can... Phil and Claire Dunphy."
Claire,"I am not going back to that hotel tonight, and I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to."
Phil,"Don't need to. Phil and Claire have a bedroom, which they can turn into a hotel whenever they want."
Claire,But the kids...
Phil,"They're not expecting us home this early. So, you up for a little adventure... Claire?"
Claire,Do you think you can handle it... Phil?
Haley,"""I can't be the girl you want me to be, David. I can only be me. Goodbye. Haley."""
Manny,Send it.
Haley,I don't know.
Manny,"Here, I'll help you."
Haley,"No, no, no, no, no! Wow. That feels really good."
Manny,Because you're free.
Haley,And really scary. I haven't been single since I was 9.
Manny,"That's why you need to take your time now... Really get to know yourself before you make any decisions... Five, six years maybe."
Haley,Years?! I have to call David.
Manny,"The boy who tossed you aside on Valentine's Day? No. You deserve better, Haley - a dreamer, a poet. Wait for him. He may be closer than you think."
Haley,Do you hear music?
Manny,"Yes, and the fact that you hear it, too..."
Haley,Is that Dylan?! Oh my God!
Claire,Am I a bad enough parent to ignore that?
Phil,You are. You're really bad.
Manny,"You know, the old Haley would have..."
Haley,"I love you, baby!"
Gloria,"Salud, Jay!"
Phil,There's my back.
Mitchell,"Oh, No, keep the change."
Mitchell,Did you put an extra tiramisu in here?
Cameron,"Ryan, again?"
Mitchell,Ryan!
Cameron,Ryan!
Haley,It's so unfair. You told me I could go.
Claire,"I told you you could go if you got to be on your History exam, which you didn't."
Haley,I have a learning disability. The letters jump around on the page and appear backwards.
Claire,"Honey, we had you tested like six times. Trust me, I was praying for dyslexia."
Haley,"Oh, my God, why can't you ever let me have any fun?! Ew. Ew. Dad, gross. Your hand smells like cheese!"
Phil,"I didn't want to dirty a knife. Sit. Now, we all know when Nana Dede comes to visit, your mom can get a little..."
Haley,Psycho?
Luke,Scary.
Alex,Drunk?
Phil,"All true. Therefore, I need you guys to be on your best behavior."
Alex,Don't worry. I'll keep to myself. I have to practice for my cello recital.
Phil,"Ohh, fine. You know what? If it keeps you out of your mom's hair, yes, do that. Luke, if your mom starts to lose it, I need you to lighten the mood by being extra cute."
Luke,"No problem. I've got some stuff prepared. ""Hey, mom, I'm 'firsty.'"" Heh? Adorable, right?"
Phil,"Yeah, that's... that's good."
Luke,Don't worry. It works better in my jammies.
Mitchell,"Cam, Monica can""t come to Lily's birthday party tomorrow, her mom's gonna be in Chicago."
Cameron,"Oh, that's fantastic! What part is she playing?"
Mitchell,The city of Chicago.
Cameron,Oh. Okay. Gun to your head... Which pair should I wear?
Mitchell,"Oh. Gun to my head. I'd say, pull the trigger."
Cameron,What's that supposed to mean?
Mitchell,No Fizbo.
Mitchell,"C-Cam, the center of attention at Lily's party should be Lily, not Fizbo the needy clown."
Cameron,"I'm sorry. Excuse me. ""Needy""?"
Mitchell,"""Why aren't they laughing, Mitchell? Why aren't they clapping when I'm pulling the handkerchief out of my mouth?"""
Cameron,It's 10 feet long with boxer shorts at the end. It works on so many levels.
Mitchell,"Yeah. Well, also, it's a princess theme party, so... I guess you just don't respect party themes."
Cameron,You did not just say that.
Mitchell,I'm sorry. That was... That was crossing a line.
Cameron,"Yes, it was. So? Can Fizbo come to the party?"
Mitchell,No! No! You are Lily's dad. Just be there as her dad.
Cameron,Are you implying I'm not being a good dad now?
Mitchell,"Well, if the shoe fits..."
Cameron,They don't.They're comically large.
Luke,"Hey, mom. Dad and Nana just pulled in."
Claire,"Aah! Oh, wow."
Claire,Ohh.
Claire,Yeah.
Gloria,We're home!
Jay,"Oh, good."
Gloria,And we bought Lily a beautiful birthday gift.
Manny,Yeah. I was pushing for a cashmere throw.
Gloria,"Look, Jay. It's a talking storybook. We record ourselves reading it, and then at night, Lily can hear our voices before she goes to sleep."
Jay,Terrible idea.
Manny,Unlike the timelessness of cashmere.
Gloria,Enough with the cashmere! Why is it a terrible idea?
Jay,Don't you remember the answering-machine message?
Jay,"Hi, you've reached Jay..."
Gloria,And Gloria. Please leave a message after the...
Jay,"You didn't say ""beep."""
Gloria,"If I say ""beep,"" then the people will think it's the beep."
Jay,"No, I think they're gonna know to wait for the actual beep."
Gloria,I don't think they'll know.
Jay,Just trust me.
Gloria,"Okay, fine."
Jay,"Hi, you've reached Jay..."
Gloria,And Gloria. Please leave a message after the beeeeeep!
Jay,What was that?
Gloria,You told me to make the beep.
Jay,"No, I didn't tell you to make the beep. I told you to say the word ""beep."""
Gloria,"If I say the word, then people think it's the beep."
Jay,It's not the beep!
Gloria,Then why even say it?!
Claire,Mm. Who's that?
Claire,"Robbie... my Robbie Sullivan from high school? God, I haven't seen him in...years."
Haley,"Oh, really, mom?"
Claire,That's...not true.
Claire,You read my diary!
Claire,"Mm-hmm. So, mom..."
Phil,"Okay, buddy. We're gonna need you on the front lines sooner than expected. Are you ready to be cute?"
Luke,Please.
Phil,Go get 'em.
Luke,"Hi, mommy. My tummy's growling. Can I have some pas- ghetti?"
Claire,"Sweetie, you're hurting me. And take a shower tonight, your hair smells like cheese. I'll get it."
Luke,"Okay, I need a giant lollipop, and I need it now."
Claire,"Oh, my God."
Claire,Robbie?!
Claire,What?
Claire,Huh? I... Uh-huh. I don't know what to say.
Claire,Ohh...
Phil,"Hey, honey, who's this?"
Claire,"This is, um... Robbie... My boyfriend from when I was 17 years old, whom my mom invited to dinner."
Phil,Fasten your seatbelts. Phil Dunphy.
Phil,I know Claire from being married to Claire.
Claire,Mom didn't mention that I'm married with three kids?
Claire,Really?
Claire,Okay. Mom?
Claire,"Uh, no. Not really. Why would you not mention that I'm married?"
Claire,Mom...
Claire,...I could use some help in the kitchen.
Luke,Whoa. You came here in a limo?
Luke,Are you rich?
Phil,"Luke, that's not polite. Maybe Robbie isn't rich, but he needs a limo because he has a lot of DUIs."
Luke,Cool.
Phil,"Oh... I don't think we need to... I am just wearing socks, buddy."
Claire,I just don't understand why you invited him to my house.
Claire,Yes. Yes.
Claire,You raised me.
Claire,Uh-huh.
Claire,And did you think it might be a hoot to ask me first?
Claire,"Of course, mom. Of course I would have said no."
Gloria,"""Once upon a time, there lived a family of bears. There was papa bear""...That's you, Jay."
Jay,Ah. Okay. Let's see.
Gloria,Do you want me to hold it and stand in the driveway?
Jay,"""Holy mackerel, this is good salmon."" I feel like they missed an oppor..."
Gloria,"Shh! ""I don't want to eat the fish. They are my friends!"""
Jay,What kind of voice is that?
Gloria,I am a bear.
Jay,A bear? I was gonna get a crucifix.
Gloria,"""And then the baby bear said..."""
Manny,"""Good night, mama. Good night, papa. This has been the best day ever."""
Gloria,"And after she kissed her parents good night, she drifted off to sleep. The end."""
Manny,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. She? Baby bear's a girl? We have to do it over. I would have played it totally different."
Jay,I think you nailed it.
Manny,And what's that supposed to mean?
Gloria,"Manny, you're fine. But, Jay, I need to tell you something."
Jay,"It's a bear, Gloria. I did the best I could."
Gloria,"No. I don't want you to get upset about this, but I'm not going to the party."
Jay,What?
Gloria,"Yeah, it's because your ex-wife is going to be there, and we're never good together. I'm feeling very nervous. It's better that I stay here."
Jay,Wow. I... I don't know what to say.
Jay,Greatest news ever!
Gloria,So you're okay with this?
Jay,"Well, I wouldn't say I'm okay with it, but I get it. I feel like I'm in the same boat with your friend's daughter's first communion coming up. I always felt like the husband never liked me. Maybe you're right. I should probably skip it."
Mitchell,"Wait, wait, wait. So Robbie Sullivan's at your house right now."
Claire,"Yes, he is having dinner with my family."
Claire,"Every time he opens his mouth, I can feel my daughters losing respect for me."
Mitchell,"You know, I never liked that guy. He used to always put me in a headlock. It is amazing the freaks we used to date."
Cameron,"'Ello, gov'nah!"
Mitchell,I gotta jump. All right. Let's hear it.
Cameron,"Sir Fizbo-lot, royal court Jester, at your service. I understand there's a little princess 'oos in need of a jolly good time!"
Mitchell,No!
Cameron,"Your 'ighness said that the clown doesn't fit the princess theme. But ""mefinks""... That a court Jester is right as rain!"
Mitchell,There goes the theory that an English accent makes everyone sound smart.
Cameron,"Oh, come on. It's gonna be a boring party without any entertainment."
Mitchell,"I agree, which is why I hired a princess. Cue the gasp."
Cameron,How could you do that? How dare you?! Entertaining and delighting children is who I am.
Mitchell,Just be a parent.
Cameron,But I want to...
Mitchell,Go.
Cameron,I want to...
Mitchell,Now. Stop.
Gloria,"I was thinking about what you said, and maybe I should go to the party."
Jay,What'd I say? I didn't say anything.
Gloria,About Maria Victoria's first communion. We cannot let other people make us miss important family events.
Jay,What?
Gloria,"I'm gonna miss Alex's graduation, all of Haley's weddings, just because of Dede? I love them. They're my family, too."
Jay,"Whoa, whoa. Slow down. You're up to weddings already? H- h-how about this? Try missing tomorrow, and then just see how that feels."
Gloria,"Ay, Jay. You're so good to me. That's why I have to go. You're gonna be there for me the same way I'm gonna be there for you at Maria Victoria's first communion."
Jay,Wait a minute. That's back on the table?
Claire,"Well, you know, we didn't want to break curfew."
Haley,"I love your stories, Nana. Keep on goin'."
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,"Hey, hey! Ha ha ha ha!"
Phil,"Halfway through dinner, I told Claire that whenever she had the urge to lash out at her mother, she should just squeeze my hand instead. A doctor had to cut off my wedding ring."
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Claire,Giant panda bear!
Claire,Yeah. Yes.
Claire,Yes.
Claire,Not this one.
Alex,"Wow, mom."
Claire,Mom?
Claire,"Okay, I think we're... we're done."
Alex,Who is Alex Trebek?
Alex,No reason.
Claire,Yes?
Claire,It was so great.
Claire,I know.
Claire,Really good.
Phil,"Hey, you... you take good care. You take good care, now. Yes. Ohh, let's do it. Let's do that."
Haley,Bye!
Alex,"Really, mom?"
Claire,I was young.
Haley,I thought he was sexy.
Claire,Go to your room.
Haley,Okay.
Claire,"I did it. She brought all the crazy in her arsenal, and I did not crack."
Phil,I think a bone in my hand did.
Claire,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Phil,You know what hurt more?
Claire,What?
Phil,"I used to think your mother loved me. Apparently, she always wished you'd married Robbie."
Claire,"Oh, no, sweetie. This was all about her trying to annoy me."
Phil,Come on. She's practically walking you two down the aisle.
Claire,Ohh. Oh. He left his phone.
Phil,"All those mother's day cards I sent her... All those joke e- mails she forwarded to me months after I'd already seen them. Well, no more polite ""LOLs"" for you, Dede."
Claire,Oh! Oh!
Phil,"Holy cow! Wow. Okay, well... You were right. It's not about me."
Claire,"Oh, God."
Mitchell,Stop eyeing the princess. You're gonna freak her out.
Cameron,"I don't know. I-I think the whole idea of needing a prince to come along and make you happy, sends the wrong message, Mitchell. I really do."
Mitchell,Really? And a grown man pulling boxer shorts out of his mouth doesn't.
Cameron,I'm...
Claire,"Hi, sweetie."
Mitchell,"Hey, Phil."
Phil,Hey.
Claire,So...Where is she? Where's mom?
Jay,"Yeah, let's get the weirdness over with."
Mitchell,"Oh, no. I thought she was coming with you."
Claire,"Oh, no, no. I haven't seen mom since... let's see... oh, she made out with my ex-boyfriend last night."
Jay,What?
Claire,Yeah.
Mitchell,"No, my God!"
Claire,"Yeah. Yeah. And then she took off with him, didn't come back to the house until after I was asleep, and then this morning left a cute little note that said, ""having breakfast with Robbie!"""
Jay,What the hell is she doing? He's half her age! Don't say it.
Gloria,"I think it's sweet. Love is beautiful. It has no age. When it's meant to be, it's meant to be. That is the question."
Claire,"Dad, what's going on over there?"
Jay,"She was a little nervous about your mother being here, so she tried her first Xanax, washed it down with a shot of tequila."
Gloria,"Ay, look at the princess. It's so beautiful."
Cameron,Really? 'Cause I don't see it.
Cameron,Excuse me.
Cameron,"Glitter? That'll settle in her lungs. So, I wanted to ask what method of payment you prefer... Cash, credit card, check?"
Cameron,That's nice. But I really need to know.
Cameron,"Miss, seriously, if you want to get paid, I need to..."
Cameron,"Never break character. Never, ever!"
Cameron,"""But"" nothing. When I was a clown, my shoe caught on fire, and one of my fellow clowns put me out with a bucket of flammable confetti."
Cameron,"Even as they loaded me into the ambulance, I continued to make balloon animals!"
Mitchell,Flammable confetti?
Cameron,There was a seltzer bottle right there!
Mitchell,I cannot believe it. She brought him to the party!
Claire,"Oh, my God! I'm gonna kill her. I'm gonna..."
Mitchell,"Stop. No, not... not now. The last thing I need is some big scene, Claire."
Claire,"You know, she's doing this just to torture me. Mm-hmm."
Mitchell,"No, no. She's doing this to get back at me because I didn't let her stay with us."
Jay,You're both wrong. This is about me. I got the young girl. She had to get the young guy.
Phil,"Well, she and I are good. We had a long talk last night after you and I ""split"" that bottle of wine, and you ""fell asleep"" on the stairs."
Gloria,"I don't know why everybody's getting so upset about this. Maybe it's about passion, about what the body wants, what the... what the heart wants for the heart."
Claire,"Dad, seriously, can you deal with Cheech and Chong?"
Gloria,"Oh, buenos dias, Dede... B-buenos... ...Mi amor bella. ¿Cómo está?"
Jay,"Uh, yeah. Uh, Gloria... Come on. That's enough."
Mitchell,"Hi, mom. Hi."
Mitchell,Thank you for coming.
Mitchell,"Yes, I do. Yes. Hi."
Mitchell,"So, Robbie, it looks like the years have been treating you good, huh?"
Mitchell,Okay. Um...
Mitchell,Yeah. Please stop. Is my baby watching?
Claire,"I need to talk to you for a second. Let me just... Whoa, whoa, whoa. ...Ask you a little something. What are you doing with my mother?"
Claire,She's my mother!
Claire,Ew! You were dating me and fantasizing about my mother?
Claire,What?
Claire,"Uh, no."
Claire,"Oh, my God. Are you insane?"
Claire,You're insane.
Claire,No. Don't.
Claire,"Oh, really."
Claire,"Didn't swoop! I didn't swoop. If anybody swooped, it was you! You swooped!"
Mitchell,"Claire, hush. Not now! Not now! Not now."
Claire,"No, stop, please. She accused me of trying to steal my old boyfriend from her."
Mitchell,"Okay, fine, but make it quick."
Claire,"Why does everything have to be so hard with you? Why can't you just be a normal old grandma?! Why do you... You come in here, it's some sort of sick game for you to just push people and push people and push people and see how far you can push them! And so fine... Look at me! You win! You win! I'm screaming at a princess party, mom!"
Phil,: Claire. Claire...
Claire,I'm screaming at a princess party!
Phil,"Claire, Claire, Claire, Claire. Robbie? I think maybe, you know, you should take off."
Jay,Hey. Time to go.
Jay,"I'm doing good. But I never liked you in the basement with my daughter, and I don't like you here with my ex."
Mitchell,So much for keeping it all about Lily.
Cameron,"Well, yeah, and I certainly didn't help by berating that perfectly sweet journeyman princess like I did."
Mitchell,"Oh, God, look at this place. Everybody's traumatized. Oh, we need somebody to pump some life back into this party, huh?"
Mitchell,Or...
Cameron,Is that a roundabout way of saying a certain clown can come to the party?
Mitchell,I was wrong. Every kid wants a clown for a dad.
Cameron,Oh! You just made a little girl very happy.
Mitchell,"Yes, well, I can see that."
Jay,You okay?
Jay,'Cause you know Claire gets stressed out. That stuff she said out there...
Jay,Yeah.
Jay,"You got flattered by the attention of a younger guy, and you got a little carried away. So what?"
Jay,You did the right thing. We were stalled. I didn't have the guts to end it.
Gloria,"Huh? No, Dede! Ay, ¿qué pasa? Oh. Ha ha."
Claire,"So, maybe it isn't about me?"
Mitchell,Or me.
Jay,I told you it was about me!
Gloria,No! No!
Phil,I got Gloria! I got Gloria!
Cameron,This is such a precious gift!
Mitchell,I know. I can't believe my dad sat down and did this.
Cameron,Keep going.
Gloria,"Jay, pay attention. It's your line!"
Jay,"I just had a damn line. Manny, freshen this up for me."
Gloria,"No, no more drinks until we finish this."
Jay,Who cares? Cam's just gonna return it anyway.
Mitchell,Cue gasp.
Phil,Morning.
Claire,Hey.
Phil,Did you sleep all right?
Claire,"No. You? Say no, Phil."
Phil,Of course no. I missed you up there.
Claire,"Last night, I know I got kind of carried away..."
Phil,"No, no, no. You don't need to apologize."
Claire,I don't think that I was apologi...
Phil,You were right to be mad.
Claire,"Sometimes I just feel like I have to scream to let you know how upset I am, but you get it now, right?"
Phil,I... do.
Phil,"Not. No idea whatsoever. Ohh, if I knew, but... no."
Claire,Good. So let's pretend the whole thing never happened.
Phil,"What were we even fighting about, huh?"
Luke,What the heck happened in here? The raccoon get through the dog door again?
Phil,"Yep. The raccoon got in, and your mom fought it off with the fire extinguisher."
Luke,You're a mess! Are you okay?
Phil,"Careful, buddy. Not today. I think you look beautiful."
Claire,Save it.
Jay,"One time I forgot to get Gloria a birthday present, and I paid for it. Another time I remembered, but she didn't like the gift. I paid for that. So you'd think when I remember to buy her a gift and she loves it, I wouldn't have to pay for it, right?"
Cameron,"Oh, hey, good. Grab the other end of this and help me get it out of here. I have to start setting up the chairs for tonight."
Mitchell,"Oh, tonight? What's tonight?"
Cameron,"Are you kidding me? This is what I'm talking about, Mitchell. You never listen when I..."
Mitchell,"It's a fundraiser for the friends of the Third Street Overpass Music Society. Two harpists are performing, and you're anxious 'cause Andrew, your nemesis from the steering committee, ran the event last year, and you want to upstage him. I was kidding."
Cameron,Ha.
Mitchell,"Cam has it in his head that I don't listen to him, but I do."
Cameron,"Do you, Mitchell? Do you?"
Cameron,The doctor called and said Lily's rash is just dry skin. I'm so relieved. What did I just say?
Mitchell,"You act like you listen to every single thing that I say, but you don't."
Cameron,"Don't I, Mitchell?"
Cameron,"Hey, I'm going to the store today. Do you need me to pick anything up for you?..."
Cameron,"Razor blades, saline solution, black socks, and the new issue of Vanity Fair."
Mitchell,Wow. I don't even remember asking for all that. Thank you.
Cameron,Don't I?
Jay,"How'd this thing come off, anyway?"
Claire,"Well, I was cooking dinner, and..."
Phil,Right. And the raccoon just walked in the...
Claire,And I already had the door open.
Phil,Right. Which I... I had already had ahold of the...
Jay,Why don't you two go work on your story and come back?
Phil,Okay. Okay.
Haley,I won't be home till late. I have another shift at the restaurant.
Phil,"That's our working girl. Let the river run, honey."
Haley,Check it! $57 in tips from last night. Holla!
Claire,"Honey, that's impressive. You know what? $57 from you, $57 from us... You keep this up, we are going to be buying you a car by the summer."
Luke,"Mom, is this ""upscale casual""?"
Claire,What?
Phil,"Oh, yeah. Cam hired Luke to help out with the benefit tonight."
Jay,"Hey, you know what? I can't fix this thing."
Claire,"What? I need that. I use it every day. Okay, Phil, what do you say? You want to take a trip to the mall with me?"
Phil,I... do.
Phil,"Not, if I can possibly avoid it. Claire has this little... habit... At the mall, where sh... I can't even talk about it."
Gloria,"Jay, come on! I want to go home because you said you were going to film me doing the karaoke so I can send it to Colombia to my mother."
Phil,"Claire, um, about the mall? I was actually gonna run out and get my hair cut this afternoon."
Jay,"Well, hang on here. Why don't I run Claire down the mall, and you give Phil a haircut? You're always talking about how you miss working at the salon."
Gloria,I guess I could. I do Jay. Why can't I do you?
Phil,"You... can do me. Okay, let's get this party started. You know that song?"
Jay,"Let's go, let's go! We're wasting time!"
Phil,"O... okay, okay. Yeah."
Gloria,You know it?
Phil,I think I do.
Cameron,"So, that was Andrew, who practically choked telling me that no one had called in their regrets for the event tonight. It is gonna be a full house."
Mitchell,"Oh, that must feel great!"
Cameron,"Oh, I never thought I would enjoy having an archenemy. - Oh. But I do, Mitchell. I do. Hmm."
Mitchell,"Hey, Lily, what you got there?"
Cameron,"I do feel bad for those PETA folks. Their event's tonight, too. That's why I had you mail the invitations so long ago. I shouldn't laugh. I do feel bad for those little PETA animals. I really do. What are you doing?"
Mitchell,"Nothing. She was, uh... she was, uh, sucking her thumb again."
Mitchell,"Yes, I put Cam's invites in my car to take them to the post office and then threw my gym bag on top of them and completely forgot they existed. Ohh, I feel terrible. Haven't been to the gym in six weeks. And I ruined Cam's event."
Mitchell,"Hello, Miss Hartwick. Uh, Cam and I are hosting a little event tonight, and... Yes, yes. No, I am aware that there is also a PETA event, and... ohh."
Cameron,Who are you talking to?
Mitchell,I'm in the shower!
Cameron,"Luke, how are those chairs coming? Come in."
Luke,I think you should come in come in.
Cameron,"Oh, now I'm worried about the flow. The eyes should go to the harps, not the backs of chairs."
Luke,Are you gonna get upset and starting eating all the appetizers again?
Cameron,It is amazing what you notice and what you don't notice. Please handle that. I need to think.
Luke,"Come on, Luke."
Luke,I think so. Why?
Cameron,"Oh, oh! The wait staff. Please, Luke, show them to the kitchen, please."
Cameron,"Oh. Hello, Andrew."
Cameron,"Oh, well, thank you for thinking of us, but shouldn't you be getting back home to Donald? That is the name of your cat, isn't it?"
Cameron,Drive safely. What did I tell you?
Luke,She's even worse than you said.
Gloria,Hold still! You can't move like that. It's like cutting the hair of a cuckoo bird.
Phil,I'm sorry. I'm just a little tense today.
Gloria,"I knew it. Something happened. Because when somebody works in a salon, they know when someone needs to talk."
Phil,"Actually, you might be able to help me with this one. Claire and I got into a huge fight last night... And I'm not even sure what it was about."
Gloria,Was that why you didn't want to go to the mall with her?
Phil,"Oh. No, that was... more about a weird... mall habit Claire has."
Claire,"Oh, my god! That's good! Oh, oh! Go low, go low. Go low, go low. Oh! Oh! Oh, my god! Dad! Dad! You got to get one of these! Oh! Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh."
Alex,It is impressive how much Haley's earning. She's over $500 already.
Manny,That's a lot of cheddar.
Manny,"You know, I stopped by the restaurant a couple times, and she wasn't there."
Alex,When?
Manny,"Uh, I don't remember. I was at the mall for a movie."
Alex,Think! I need details!
Manny,"Okay, it was a romantic comedy my now ex-friend Reuben recommended..."
Alex,Not about the movie! What day?! Focus!
Manny,"Okay, uh, it was Tuesday, but I also ate there again on Saturday, and she wasn't there then, either."
Alex,"Oh, my god. I bet she doesn't even work there."
Manny,"Well, then, where's all this money coming from?"
Alex,"Do you notice how every single night is just under $60? Grandpa gave her $60 for her birthday. She's just hanging around the mall all day, flashing the same cash every night, and fooling my parents into buying her a car. Hey, dad! Can we eat at Haley's restaurant tonight?!"
Phil,"Hey, there's a good idea!"
Alex,Great. I'll text her.
Haley,"Oh, god, no!"
Claire,"Oh, god, yes! Oh! Oh, god, yes! Oh, get after it! Ohh! Amazing. I'm going for 15 more on me."
Jay,I think you got what you needed from that.
Claire,Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Jay,"You know, maybe you do need to talk about this fight."
Claire,With Phil?
Gloria,How could you not know what she was mad about?
Phil,Because she didn't tell me. She just freaked out.
Claire,"I cannot believe you, Phil! How could you?!"
Phil,What is happening? What... what did I do?
Claire,"Are you serious? You are! You don't know. We've had this conversation a hundred times. You know... no, no. I'm not... I'm not doing this again. You tell me what you did."
Phil,Uh...
Claire,"""Uh..."""
Phil,Was it...
Claire,"""Was it..."""
Phil,Uh...
Claire,"""Uh""? No, Phil. No. No, no, no. No! I'm going to get some air."
Phil,Claire. Claire!
Claire,No! Don't follow me.
Phil,Happy valen-birth-iversary!
Jay,Storming off... right out of your mom's playbook.
Claire,Mm.
Jay,Where'd you go?
Claire,"Well, as it turns out, not very far."
Claire,"Phil! Phil, you moron, stop it! It's me, you idiot!"
Phil,I'm sorry!
Claire,What are you doing?!
Phil,I'm sorry! I thought you were a raccoon!
Claire,"You thought I was a raccoon! Because people look so much like raccoons. Oh, look. There's one now!"
Phil,"No, Claire, no! Claire!"
Gloria,Wait a minute. Not even crazy woman go crazy for no reason. What happened before the broccoli?
Phil,"That's just it... it came out of the blue. I walked in the door, we're having a conversation about nothing."
Phil,"Hey, honey."
Claire,Hi.
Phil,Sorry I got stuck at the office. How was your day?
Claire,It was good. Although you know what?
Phil,What?
Claire,"Debbie stood me up for lunch. Rude, right?"
Phil,No. She called.
Claire,I didn't get a message.
Phil,Yeah. You did. I left you one. It's right... there.
Gloria,"That's it! How is she supposed to see this? If you give me a message this tiny, I kill you."
Phil,But that's not when she got mad.
Phil,"Also, I talked to the insurance company about that little accident that ""wasn't your fault"" because the brakes weren't ""working right."" And that's not gonna cost us as much money as I thought, so that's good."
Gloria,"That's it! You insult a woman's driving, and you use the ""Air bunnies."" You do that to me, and I kill you."
Phil,"I hear you, but the screaming still hadn't started yet."
Phil,"So, I'm having lunch with Skip Woosnum, right? Boy, can that guy go on and on. Tangent after tangent. By the way, turned me on to the greatest thing... wedge salad... you go to try it. Anyhoo... Guess who's sitting at the table next to us. My old girlfriend Carla. Yeah! We're gonna grab coffee. She lost a ton of weight."
Gloria,"How stupid are you? You tell me that you're seeing an old girlfriend, and I..."
Phil,"Kill me, I know. But she still hadn't snapped yet."
Phil,I almost forgot. I picked up the broccoli you asked for. Cauliflower. Can't believe I did that again.
Claire,"I cannot believe you, Phil!"
Gloria,You didn't do one thing wrong. You do everything wrong! I don't even know why she talks to you.
Phil,She said she was okay.
Gloria,"No. No woman is okay with this. We don't forget. We wait. And then, when you least expect it, We make you pay. Chin up!"
Phil,Ohh.
Gloria,Up!
Jay,So you had a meltdown over that.
Claire,"I did, because ever since I met him, I've been trying to get Phil to try a wedge salad. The minute that Skip Woosnum, whom he doesn't even like, suggests it, Phil thinks it's the greatest thing ever, and he does this with everything. He does it with books, with movies, with TV. He listens to everybody's opinion but mine, and it drives me crazy."
Jay,You two seemed fine this morning.
Claire,"Well, we were because we talked about it, which, by the way, if you want this whole karaoke thing with Gloria to go away, that's what you need to do."
Jay,That's easier said than done.
Claire,"Well, since when do you shy away from confrontation, Mr. Tough Talk, Mr. Straight Shooter? Getting a little soft, grandpa?"
Jay,"You know, when you get a massage, you sound like a Tijuana prostitute."
Cameron,"Luke, phone."
Luke,Friends of the Third Street...
Cameron,Is that Mitchell? What's taking him?
Luke,"No, it's not Mitchell. It's... I don't understand his name."
Cameron,"Hello? Oh, hi, Longinus. Listen, did you get my message? About the chiavari chairs... I want you to bring them when you come. What do you mean you're not... not coming? Well, that's not possible. Mitch... Mitch mailed them weeks ago. What about Pepper? Did he get his? And L'Michael? And Steven and Stefan? And Bob? I have to go. Get me your uncle Mitchell."
Luke,I don't know his number. It went to voicemail.
Cameron,Of course it did. Keep trying him until you get him. It's one button. Just... redial.
Mitchell,"Hey, really great event tonight benefiting the music society... musicians like you. Okay. Hey!"
Luke,Uncle Cam for uncle Mitchell.
Cameron,"How could you, Mitchell?! Honestly! Give me that. You want to hear the guest list for night? So far it's anger, betrayal, terror, and sadness. Congratulations, Mitchell, you packed the house!"
Mitchell,"Cam, I am so sorry. I... I... I'm gonna fix it. I'll make a big donation."
Cameron,That's not gonna keep them from kicking me off the steering committee! When Andrew walks in here and sees a room full of empty chairs...
Mitchell,You know he's not really your archenemy. that's sort of a made-up thing.
Cameron,Fix it!
Haley,Hi! You came!
Claire,Hi! Of course we did. We wanted to see you work. - Oh.
Phil,"We're so proud of you, sweetheart."
Alex,"Yeah, we're all proud. So where's our table?"
Haley,"Actually, bad news. We're totally booked. We have a ton of reservations."
Alex,"Yeah, one's ours. I called. Here it is!"
Phil,Hey.
Haley,"Uh, so, your table is right here."
Claire,"Oh, honey, would you mind getting us a couple drinks? I would love an iced tea."
Phil,"Same, please."
Alex,"I'll have a mango-kiwi smoothie, yogurt instead of ice cream, and make it low-fat. I want to look good when I'm riding in your new car."
Claire,"Honey, I got to say, I like this haircut."
Phil,"Hey, we're all just playing for second in this family."
Claire,Hmm.
Haley,"Uh, actually, no. Um, I will have more iced tea, another iced tea, and a mango-kiwi smoothie, all ice cream. I'm pregnant."
Phil,"Well, this is nice. Me, my gals, and my beautiful, beautiful wife. Just so you know, I rescheduled with Carla. I penciled her in for the 12th... of never."
Claire,That's too bad. I was kind of looking forward to hearing about that one.
Phil,"Oh. By the way, no one called for you while you were out."
Claire,Thank you?
Phil,"I just want to make sure you get any messages from any friends who might call, which none of them did."
Alex,Isn't it weird that Haley's the only one here not wearing a name tag?
Phil,"If your mother had a name tag, it would say ""good driver."""
Claire,Phil...
Haley,Here you go.
Alex,"I want to hear the specials.Haley : Uh, we're out of specials. What were they?"
Haley,"Popular, which you wouldn't understand."
Phil,"Well, what could be better than drinks with a beautiful woman? And every beautiful woman deserves flowers. Cauliflowers."
Claire,Okay. What's going on? Is this about last night?
Phil,"Yeah, I just want you to know how important to me you are."
Claire,"Sweetie, I know that. I know that."
Phil,"I still feel bad about, you know what I... did."
Claire,Listen to me. You and I are fine. Okay? I'm just really hungry. Okay?
Phil,"Okay. Okay. All right! What looks good? Oh, gosh. Oh, here's something that jumps right off the page."
Claire,Uh-huh.
Phil,"I tried this yesterday, thanks to my good friend Skip Woosnum. Claire, do yourself a favor and join me wedge salad."
Claire,You have got to be kidding me!
Phil,Just try it. You will thank me.
Claire,Did you learn nothing from last night?
Phil,Whoa. It was about the salad?
Claire,"I have been recommending wedge salads to you, Amongst other things, for years, and you never listen to me. And then some idiot suggests it, and you can't wait to try a wedge salad?! It makes me feel like I don't matter."
Haley,"Thanks a lot, dad! Mom's little outburst just got me fired!"
Phil,"Okay, I got to talk to your mom. You comfort your sister."
Alex,She never worked here!
Jay,"So, Mitchell called you, too."
Claire,Mm-hmm. I take it you haven't had your conversation with Gloria yet?
Jay,It's getting worse. She sang all the way here. We passed two cars... the dogs stuck their heads back inside the window.
Claire,Wow.
Cameron,What are we gonna do?
Luke,I could start a fire.
Cameron,No. Keep that in your back pocket.
Phil,Hey.
Claire,Hey.
Phil,I want to show you something.
Claire,"Let me guess. It's a copy of ""The book thief"" that I begged you to read, but you wouldn't until your dental hygienist said it changed her life."
Phil,Remember this?
Claire,Uh-huh.
Phil,It's the first Thanksgiving I spent with your family.
Claire,"God, I hated that ponytail."
Phil,"I know. You said it made me look like a wimpy bouncer, so I cut it off."
Claire,Mm.
Phil,Just like I lost the feathered earring... and the van with the beanbag chairs. And I changed my forestry major.
Claire,"I get it, Phil. I get it. I am the controlling witch that made you give up everything fun in your l..."
Phil,"No. No. You're the witch who saved me. Look. Look at this picture. Now look at this guy. You can't tell me our opinion doesn't matter. You changed me for the better in a hundred different ways. Yeah, I... I might miss a book or a salad here and there, but... I've got Claire all over me."
Claire,You're about to.
Gloria,That's the worst sound in the world.
Jay,Is it?
Cameron,"Friends, uh, family, uh, board members..."
Cameron,"I know we were all looking forward to hearing the beautiful stylings of Harp Attack, but there has, unfortunately, been a slight..."
Mitchell,Don't start yet!
Mitchell,"I know this isn't what you were hoping for, but I need to do a better job of listening to you."
Cameron,"No, no, you did the best you could, and, plus, this is double what Andrew had last year for ""Cello submarine."" Thank you."
Mitchell,Oh.
Cameron,Oh... how are you sitting at a harp and not scoring this moment? Ladies!
Jay,You can't have a successful marriage without being a good listener. Sometimes it takes a little work...
Cameron,"I just wonder what they're gonna do with their lives, you know? I just wonder how they can actually, you know, ever find their true calling with a harp."
Jay,Sometimes it takes a lot of work...
Phil,Harps!
Jay,And sometimes it's just excruciating.
Gloria,"Jay, come. I work out another song."
Jay,Gloria. Gloria.
Manny,"No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! I can't take it anymore! Okay? It's not singing, it's screaming. Mom, I love you, but for the love of god, destroy that thing before it destroys this family! Coward!"
Jay,"I think you sound great, but if it bothers the kid..."
Manny,Coward!
Manny,"You keep this up, and this won't be the last plug I pull."
Claire,"Well, how many people have ordered DVDs and haven't paid for them?"
Phil,Claire...
Claire,"Um, yeah. Uh, I guess I could stop by and..."
Phil,"Really, really important."
Claire,"Uh, Cheryl, can I call you back? Okay. Great. Bye. Yes? What?"
Phil,"Hey, yeah... I was going through your drawer in the bathroom looking for some lip stuff because my..."
Claire,Lips were dry.
Phil,"God, you know me."
Claire,Phil...
Phil,Remember the spa certificates we got at the children's hospital auction?
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,"Well, look at this... they expire tomorrow."
Claire,"Oh, wow. What are you gonna do?"
Phil,"Claire, I don't think you're grasping the magnitude of this package, valued at over $250."
Claire,Sweetie...
Phil,"If you don't use them, then all our money just goes to charity."
Claire,"And so what am I supposed to do? Somewhere between dropping off Alex at orchestra and picking up Luke from practice... Oh, and burning a bunch of DVDs of the talent show, I'm gonna, what, pop in for a quick salt scrub?"
Phil,I thought Cheryl was doing the DVDs.
Claire,"Well, she's supposed to, but somehow she's got me doing it."
Phil,"Here's what you do. Say, ""Cheryl, no can do today. Need a little 'me time.'"""
Claire,"Have you met Cheryl? That'll be my new nickname. I'll be Claire ""me time"" Dunphy. It's not worth the headache."
Phil,Just say you're sick.
Claire,"Then I run into her, and it'll be a whole thing."
Phil,"Well, if that happens, you say you're on your way to the pharmacy to..."
Claire,"Phil, darling, no, not helping."
Phil,Fine. I'll give them to Florence Gunderman at work. Her hands look gross ever since she took up the banjo.
Haley,"Hey, mom, I need some money for lunch. We're all gonna go to... Oh, my God! Take off my sweater! Mom, tell her to take it off!"
Claire,"Alex, take it off."
Alex,"Last week, she wore my sweatshirt without asking."
Claire,That is true.
Haley,"Oh, please... that was an honor for your stupid old sweatshirt. It was the first time the top half got any exercise. Now, mom, that's my favorite sweater! I just got it."
Claire,"You know what you girls need to learn to do? You need to learn to share, because that's what sisters do. All right, Haley, nothing's gonna happen to your sweater. Right, Alex?"
Alex,Hmm?
Haley,"Okay, fine. Then I will just go put on your favorite nerdy t- shirt, the one with the guy from ""Back to the future"" on it."
Alex,That's Albert Einstein! And it is not nerdy!
Claire,Well...
Mitchell,Hi!
Cameron,"Hey, daddy."
Mitchell,"How was the farmers' market? Well, it was great, but guess what the new spinach is."
Cameron,"Um, radicchio?"
Mitchell,Kale.
Cameron,No!
Mitchell,I know. I was just as blown away as you are.
Claire,"Oh, well, I guess we're going to have to adopt... yay... a new attitude towards kale. Maybe we'll even adopt a new vinaigrette. Adopt, yay!"
Mitchell,"Okay, what's going on here?"
Cameron,"I'm taking the negative charge out of the word ""adopted."" Yay."
Mitchell,What did Oprah do now?
Cameron,"Well, she had a girl on who, at 16, found out that she was adopted and felt betrayed, ran away, and became a stripper... and not the heart-of-gold kind, the by-the-airport kind."
Mitchell,Okay.
Cameron,"All right. Go get your gavel, judge Judy."
Mitchell,"No, not at all. I'm adopting..."
Cameron,Ahh!
Mitchell,...a tolerant attitude toward your flights of lunacy.
Cameron,Adopting! Yay!
Claire,"Alex, come on. Hurry up. The later we are, the more Cheryl texts me to do."
Alex,"I'm coming, I'm coming."
Claire,Tell me again why the violin just wasn't you.
Alex,"It's too happy. Oh, my God!"
Claire,"Okay, hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Let's see. It might not be a big deal. Just... here we go. Let's see. Oh, okay."
Alex,Is it bad?
Claire,"No, it's gonna be fine. You're gonna be okay. Oh, honey."
Haley,"Hey, I forgot my phone."
Claire,Hi.
Haley,What?
Claire,Nothing. I love you.
Haley,"So weird. You better not spill anything on that, okay, dork?"
Alex,Relax. Half the 11th grade's been inside this sweater.
Claire,More than anything I want my girls to stop fighting and be close. I want them to share clothes and do each other's hair and gossip about boys... Like I used to do with Mitchell.
Jay,"Gloria! Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
Manny,"Hey, Jay, have you noticed a spring in my step?"
Jay,"Oh, kids say cruel things. That doesn't mean you'll turn out that way."
Manny,No. We have something in common. I'm seeing a younger woman.
Jay,How much younger are we talking about?
Manny,13 months. Her name's Chloe. She makes me feel like a 5th grader again.
Jay,"Good for you, kid."
Gloria,Hmm. There they are... my two dirty old men.
Jay,"Hey, pretty soon you're gonna be north of 40 and I'm gonna have to trade you in for a newer model. Am I right, buddy?"
Manny,"That's my mother, Jay."
Jay,You ready?
Gloria,It's such a beautiful day. Why do we have to do this?
Jay,"Because when this thing is behind us, it's done and we never have to think about it again. Come on."
Jay,"I went to a funeral last Saturday, and it got me thinking about where Gloria and I were gonna end up after we die."
Gloria,"Yeah, it's been a fun week."
Jay,I don't like loose ends. So I made a few calls. I found these people selling a couple of primo plots in the best cemetery in town. Not that I'm gonna go there anytime soon.
Gloria,Don't be so sure... with all the bacon that he eats.
Jay,"Well, got to give my cholesterol pills something to do."
Mitchell,"Mm. I don't care how much they promote it, kale is a garnish. It's not ready to anchor a meal."
Cameron,Look at this.
Mitchell,"Oh, my God! Lily's little hat that we bought her at the airport in Vietnam. Remember how cute she looked in that?"
Cameron,Remember how I used to wear it and walk around and act like I had a giant head?
Mitchell,Mm-hmm. That was good acting.
Cameron,Oh...
Mitchell,"So, what are you doing?"
Cameron,"I'm putting together a little scrapbook of how Lily became ours. You know, her adoption certificate, some pictures of her from her village... All out in the open, so she has nothing to be ashamed of."
Mitchell,You leaving that on all day?
Cameron,"You know, and I'm also gonna write a little storybook... You know, something I can read her at bedtime. It's called ""Two monkeys and a panda."" She's the panda because she's Asian."
Mitchell,And we're monkeys because...
Cameron,I can draw monkeys.
Mitchell,"Okay, well, I think this is a great project, and I believe you are gonna finish it."
Cameron,"Oh, my God."
Mitchell,What?
Cameron,"Lily's adoption certificate. Her name is ""Lily Tucker Pritchett."""
Mitchell,Right.
Cameron,"Not ""Tucker-Pritchett"" like it's supposed to be. First name... ""Lily."" Middle name... ""Tucker."" Last name... ""Pritchett."""
Mitchell,"Well, that can't be right."
Cameron,This is a legal document! She only has your last name. M... m...my name is just a middle name!
Mitchell,Stay calm. Don't get upset.
Cameron,Nobody knows anyone's middle name! Quick... what's my middle name?
Mitchell,Scott.
Cameron,Of course you know mine. We're a couple!
Mitchell,"Okay, look, t...this is obviously a mistake."
Cameron,But you're the one who filled out this paperwork. You don't make mistakes like this. You correct mistakes like this. You did this on purpose.
Mitchell,What?
Cameron,So your name could have top billing.
Mitchell,"Okay, no, I am not gonna sit here and listen to you accuse me of something so horrible!"
Cameron,It makes so much sense now... Why you wanted to fill out all these legal forms.
Mitchell,"Okay, well, I'm a lawyer! I fill out all the legal forms, ever since you signed up for a 12-year gym membership!"
Cameron,"The more you spend, the more you save!"
Phil,"All the women at work were too busy to use this certificate, so I called the spa and asked them to extend the expiration date. But they said no. Really? Here's something they didn't count on. You mess with Phil Dunphy, the claws come out."
Phil,"Thank you, Kim. I appreciate that. My wife never seems to notice. Jay ; This is it! Ta-da!"
Gloria,What is ta-da?
Jay,I'm just saying this is it. Ta-da.
Gloria,"""Ta-da"" is when you do a flip or where the magician cuts the pretty lady in half, not when you show someone where you want to shove their dead body."
Jay,"I'm not gonna argue the proper use of ""ta-da."" This is it."
Gloria,Seriously? In the file cabinet?
Jay,It's called a crypt. And how are you not getting how great this is? We're four down from Bugsy Siegel.
Gloria,No. I'm not going into any wall. I'm going in the ground.
Jay,"Sorry, not me. There's enough to not like about death without adding dirt and worms. The whole thing gives me the willies."
Gloria,"You die, you go to the ground. Is natural. You go back to the earth. Here, you're just a mushy bag of bones rotting away for all eternity! Sorry for your loss. Can we get the hell out of here?"
Jay,What am I supposed to tell the guy?
Gloria,Tell them we don't want our bodies inside these drawers where God cannot find us!
Jay,These are not like our drawers at home. People can find things in these.
Phil,"Ooh, you totally should. You would be so cute with bangs. You have the face for it. I don't. Oh, there's my better half. Kim, would you mind? Thank you. Hey, honey. Where are you?"
Claire,"Oh, I'm on my way to Downey."
Phil,"Oh, uh, did you know Karen and Richard Carpenter grew up in Downey?"
Claire,"What random and not-helpful fact, Phil. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm having kind of a rough day."
Phil,"Yeah, I'm kind of having a rough day myself."
Claire,"Look, Phil, I need you to take care of dinner for me."
Phil,What's wrong?
Claire,"Oh, Alex ripped Haley's favorite sweater, and now I'm driving around from store to store, trying to find the exact same one before Haley finds out."
Phil,Don't do that. Just explain to her what happened.
Claire,Mnh-mnh. Haley's not gonna understand.
Phil,"Sure, she will."
Claire,"No, Phil, you don't understand. I'm trying to avoid this turning into a whole big thing."
Phil,Then just get her something close. She'll never know the difference.
Claire,"Phil, could you just take care of dinner, sweetie? That's all I'm asking. That's it."
Phil,"I'm just saying, there's a simpler way to do this."
Claire,There is no simpler way. Just make dinner! Thank you.
Phil,Hello? What?
Jay,I'm sorry. Is that a friend of yours? We've made a point to get to know everyone in the neighborhood.
Jay,"Oh, I'm sorry. This is my wife, Gloria."
Jay,"I don't know what our lineup is yet. But at home, I sleep on the right side, so probably there."
Gloria,You're not rude. I'm very much younger.
Jay,Is that a problem?
Jay,"Gloria, tell them you're in."
Gloria,"I don't know, Jay. I think they have a very good point. And they're not crazy at all."
Jay,What do you mean they have a good point?
Gloria,I don't think this is going to work. Good luck getting someone into your drawers.
Cameron,It occurs to me that I may have gotten a little too upset and jumped to some conclusions that were perhaps not true. I realize now that you would never intentionally do something so unthinkable. So... I just wanted to say I'm sorry for accusing you.
Mitchell,I did it.
Cameron,I knew it! You two-faced...
Mitchell,Let me explain.
Cameron,There is... there is no explanation. There is just no excuse. I just want to know why!
Mitchell,"Okay, y... you know how, um, s... some women say that they forget how painful childbirth was? Well, I... I... I think that you are forgetting how panicked you were before we got Lily. You were freaking out."
Cameron,I was not!
Mitchell,"Okay, so, it says that we can put the mattress at one of three different levels. Which one should we do?"
Cameron,I don't know.
Mitchell,"Well, just think about how far down she should be."
Cameron,How far... I don't know! I can't do this!
Mitchell,"Okay. Oh, this latch system is great. What did people do before this?"
Cameron,I don't know! Stop asking me questions!
Mitchell,Cam...
Cameron,I can't do this! I can't!
Cameron,"Okay, well, I... I don't see what that has to do with anything."
Mitchell,"I... I was scared that... that it was just gonna all be too much for you and that you were gonna leave. And then I would be the one taking care of a baby and half of her last name would belong to the guy who left us. It was a mistake. I'm sorry. I... I wanted to have it changed, but I needed to get your signature, and I was afraid that it would start a big fight and that you would hate me and..."
Phil,"OK, I'm confused... you're saying that if she tells me she has a problem, I'm not supposed to help her?"
Phil,"But if she lets me help her, I can make her problem go away."
Phil,"Well, forgive me for being a man."
Phil,"Ooh, kiwi."
Phil,"Believe me, she doesn't think that."
Phil,"Whoa. Whoa. Maybe it's all the creams, but that just made sense, girlfriends. So if Claire says, ""I hate getting stuck in traffic,"" I shouldn't say, ""maybe u should leave earlier""..."
Phil,"Or, ""don't get on the freeway."""
Phil,"I should just say, ""I know. It's so frustrating."""
Phil,Really?
Phil,"And... and if she says, uh, uh... ""The waiter I had today was so rude,"" I shouldn't say, ""maybe you should just order something on the menu for once."""
Phil,"I should just say, ""what a jerk."""
Phil,"And if she says, ""Phil, the TV's driving me crazy,"" I should just say, ""I know! There is not enough quality programming for women."""
Phil,"Okay, now I'm confused again."
Manny,"So, I heard you had a rough time today."
Jay,"Yeah, well..."
Manny,Remember the days when we thought we'd live forever?
Jay,Don't you want to go play?
Manny,"When do I ever play? I'm kind of wrestling with this whole ""older man, younger woman"" thing. It's like Chloe and I grew up in different worlds. Today I made a joke about the wiggles. It went right over her head."
Jay,I don't know what that is.
Manny,It's an expression... means she didn't get it.
Jay,"Yeah, it sometimes.. this age thing... knocks you in the head."
Manny,That what this is about?
Jay,"I always knew your mother might remarry after I'm gone. That never bothered me. I figured her husbands would be your dad, me, and some putz who could never live up to me. But what if I'm not the main guy? What if some other guy is? What if I'm the putz?"
Manny,"When my mom and dad got divorced, do you have any idea how many guys chased after her? The phone didn't stop ringing. Men would stop her on the street. Guys would propose to her from moving cars. They were good-looking guys, Jay... with money. I think one of them was a Kennedy."
Jay,Where are you going with this?
Manny,"When you showed up, I didn't think you had a prayer. You were so nervous and sweaty, I felt sorry for you."
Jay,I had to climb three flights of stairs.
Manny,"But of all people, my mom fell for you."
Jay,I got a few moves.
Manny,She said she fell in love with you during your first fight.
Jay,What?
Manny,She said she'd finally met her match.
Jay,Oh.
Manny,"So if you think she's just gonna replace you when you're gone, then you are the putz."
Jay,"Thanks, kid, I appreciate that. I thought you liked me when I first showed up."
Manny,"Please. For the first month, I didn't even bother to learn your name."
Claire,Is she back yet?
Alex,She's on her way. Did you find it?
Claire,"I did. At the fifth store I went to. It was in the window, and I had to undress a mannequin while a creepy guy filmed it, so we have to look forward to on the Internet."
Alex,"Ugh. Thank you so much, mom."
Claire,"You're welcome. Now, go put that exactly where you found the other one, okay?"
Alex,Okay.
Claire,Mwah.
Alex,Uh-oh.
Claire,What?
Alex,The security tag... it's still on!
Claire,I told those people to take that off.
Alex,"Oh, no. She's pulling into the driveway!"
Claire,Okay. It's fine. It's fine. Don't panic. I've got it. I've got it.
Alex,She's getting out of the car!
Claire,"All right! I am doing it! I've almost got it. I... Oh, God! Oh, no!"
Alex,What is that?!
Claire,"Well, it's ink."
Alex,Aah! Hide it. Hide it. She's in the house!
Haley,"What are you doing with my sweater? Oh, my God! It's ruined!"
Alex,It was an accident!
Haley,"I knew this would happen, you idiot!"
Claire,"Hey, hey! Let's try to get along."
Haley,I wish she was never even born!
Alex,They were trying to make one with a brain!
Claire,"Not fair! Honey, you guys are both... oh... pretty smart."
Phil,"Ohh... Geez. It's that sweater, huh?"
Claire,Yeah. It is that sweater. And I did everything I can to stop them from fighting.
Phil,I don't understand why they can't see how much you love them.
Claire,"I don't know. Meanwhile, Cheryl has be calling me all day because she's angry I didn't show up."
Phil,Doesn't Cheryl have a housekeeper and a nanny? Why does she need so much help?
Claire,"I know, right?"
Phil,You work so hard. You do so much.
Claire,I do.
Phil,Of course you do.
Claire,"I do. I do. Oh, sweetie, thank you. I really appreciate that."
Phil,Hey.
Claire,Yeah?
Phil,Who's my gal?
Claire,I am.
Phil,"Darn right. Yeah. Mwah! Oh. Let me get this. Hey, by the way... notice anything different about me?"
Claire,Unh-unh. What is it?
Phil,Nothing.
Claire,A haircut?
Phil,A week ago.
Claire,"Okay, so, tell me."
Phil,Forget it. It's not important.
Claire,Okay.
Phil,I'll just go start dinner.
Jay,"Listen, I've been thinking. When I go, I want you to know... it's okay if you marry someone else."
Gloria,I know.
Jay,Because I want you be happy.
Gloria,I'll be happy.
Jay,"You're driving me crazy on purpose, right?"
Gloria,"Jay, I'm not going to marry anyone else."
Jay,"That's what you say now, but no one knows what the future holds. So I want you to have this."
Gloria,Look at this. An empty coffee can. Do you know what men used to buy me?
Jay,"When I go, toss me in the fire, sweep up my ashes, stick 'em in that. Ta-da!"
Gloria,"We need to talk about this ""ta-da."""
Jay,'Cause I don't care if it's in a wall or if it's in the ground... Just as long as I end up with you.
Gloria,"Oh, Jay."
Jay,It's perfect. Jay Pritchett sitting on the mantel in the old coffee can. That will drive the putz crazy. And I like that.
Mitchell,"Um, so, f... for whatever it's worth, I... I called the adoption attorney... Adoption, yay! And on Monday, they're gonna start the process of changing Lily's last name to ""Tucker-Pritchett."""
Cameron,Great.
Mitchell,"Again, I'm... I'm so sorry."
Cameron,Okay.
Mitchell,"Um... oh, I, uh... I took a quick pass at ""Two monkeys and a panda."" So, just let me know what you think. Um... ""Once upon a time, there were two monkeys. They loved each other very much, but there was something missing."""
Cameron,A hyphen?
Mitchell,"""They wanted a baby. And they heard that there was a very special baby in a faraway land who needed a family. She was a panda named Lily. One of the monkeys was scared. They'd never had a panda before. But they held Lily in their arms, and the scared monkey became the brave one. And the two monkeys..."""
Cameron,Coco and Miko.
Mitchell,I'm sorry. What?
Cameron,"""Coco"" and ""Miko"" are the names of the monkeys."
Mitchell,"Really? That doesn't seem like it's a little un... Coco and Miko. I like that. I like that. Coco and Miko... yeah. ""They traveled all the way home with the perfect panda that they adopted."""
Cameron,"Did she just clap? She heard ""adopted"" and clapped!"
Mitchell,"Cam! That's amazing! Oh, my God! You did that!"
Cameron,"Well, I don't..."
Mitchell,What?! You did that. That is amazing. I can't believe that.
Mitchell,"And just like that, peace returned to our house. Well, technically, it...it's my house, but... I... I will... I will fix that, too."
Mitchell,"Once we finished writing the book, we realized something."
Cameron,"We're not the only two monkeys with a panda. Gay parents are a huge market, and no one's writing for them. We thought we were sitting on a gold mine."
Mitchell,But we weren't.
Mitchell,"Oh. ""Gay parenting."""
Cameron,Oh.
Mitchell,"""Gay adoptive parenting."""
Cameron,Okay.
Mitchell,"""Gay adoption: Foreign children."""
Cameron,Wow.
Mitchell,"""Gay adoption: Asian children."""
Cameron,What?
Mitchell,"""Bisexual adoption: Asian children."" ""Transgendered adoption."""
Cameron,"Okay, come on. Let's go, Miko."
Manny,"Morning, mom."
Gloria,"Good morning, papi."
Manny,"Am I right, Jay?"
Jay,Your days ends at 2:30.
Manny,"Can't come fast enough. Quitting time. Am I right, Jay?"
Jay,Let's not make this a thing.
Manny,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is this? Where's my soft-boiled egg?"
Gloria,I scrambled it. It's good for you to try new things.
Manny,I don't want to try new things. You can't just spring this on me.
Gloria,"I have bad news, Manny. This is not the biggest curve ball that life is going to throw you."
Jay,"Buddy, don't close yourself off from new things. I ever tell you the story about me and crab cakes? Thought I didn't like them, tried them, love them."
Manny,Wow. Are the movie rights available for that one?
Phil,Dunphy spring classic. Who's gonna do the dishes for the next week? Boys versus girls. Testosterone versus estrogen. Standing up to pee versus the squat.
Claire,"Phil, come on!"
Phil,Swing and a miss.
Claire,Ohh.
Phil,"He's in her head, Luke."
Luke,And boys rule and girls drool.
Alex,You drool all the time. Mom had to take you to a specialist.
Luke,I'm still growing into my tongue.
Haley,"Hey, mom, can I go to the movies with Robin?"
Claire,"No, you may not, 'cause you are still grounded."
Haley,Then can I be sent to my room?
Claire,"No, 'cause we're having some fun family time. We're gonna spend this beautiful afternoon outside in the fresh air, getting some exercise, okay? Pitch it, Phil."
Phil,"Oh, well."
Claire,That's the game.
Luke,What do you mean? We just started.
Phil,That was our only ball.
Luke,So what? The game's over just because you're afraid of stupid Mr. Kleezak?
Phil,Yep. I'm not going over there. That was fun.
Claire,"If Hannibal Lecter and Freddy Krueger had a love child, he would be afraid of our next-door neighbor."
Phil,"I don't have a mean thing to say about anyone, but Mr. Kleezak is... not a nice person."
Claire,"Easy, honey."
Mitchell,"Hey, Haley."
Haley,"Oh, hey, Uncle Mitchell."
Mitchell,"Hey, is your mom home?"
Haley,No. She had to take Alex to the oncologist.
Mitchell,"Oh, my God, what's wrong?"
Haley,She needed new glasses.
Mitchell,Oh. Did you mean optometrist?
Haley,"Whatever. So, should I give her a message?"
Mitchell,"Yes, yes. Could you ask her if she could possibly babysit Lily on Saturday night? We'd really, really appreciate it."
Cameron,They're our gay friends.
Mitchell,"I think that was clear. I've been spending a lot of time with a lot of straight people lately. And, darling, I need a night with my homies."
Cameron,You mean homos.
Mitchell,Okay. Yeah. You know what? Maybe you should stay in and babysit.
Mitchell,"Yeah, our babysitter bailed, and we're kind of in a bind, so..."
Haley,I can do it. I can watch Lily. I'm really good. I'm babysitting Luke right now.
Mitchell,"Oh, yeah? You want... you want to babysit Lily? Oh, well, that's very sweet, honey, but you're... you're a very popular girl. I'm sure you have better things to do, so..."
Haley,"Oh, seriously, I'm totally free."
Haley,Being grounded is so much worse than it was in the olden days. My friends text and Facebook all the fun stuff they're doing while I'm stuck at home playing jenga with my dad.
Phil,Are you serious?
Haley,You don't even have to pay me. I promise I'll take super good care of her.
Mitchell,"Okay, well, that would be great. Thank you. Yes, well, we'll see you on Saturday night. Bye, sweetie."
Mitchell,Bye.
Haley,Luke? Luke?
Cameron,"What are you thinking?! Haley is a very sweet and fashionable girl, but seems hardly a responsible caregiver!"
Mitchell,"Well, you know what? We needed a sitter. She's family. I say we give her a shot."
Cameron,"A shot? Oh, with our only child? Sure, why not? If something goes wrong, we'll just pop over to the orient and grab another one."
Luke,My name is Luke Dunphy. I live next door.
Luke,I want to get our ball from your yard.
Luke,Are you going scuba diving?
Luke,Why do you have that tank?
Luke,"You mean in school? Well, I do okay. My teacher says I get distracted. Why do you have that tube in your nose?"
Luke,Really? Can I try?
Luke,"We have that in our house, but we don't need tanks."
Luke,Okay.
Alex,"Oh my God! I was watching the news, and another flock of birds fell out of the sky dead. What is happening?"
Claire,"Sweetie, you got to stop watching the news."
Alex,That's your big solution... embrace ignorance?
Luke,"What are you two arguing about? Never mind, I don't want to know. Be back in a couple hours."
Claire,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you going?"
Luke,"To my friend Walt's house to watch ""High noon."""
Phil,"Ooh, I love westerns... the bloodier, the better. That's my favorite type of movie... That and anything set against the backdrop of competitive cheerleading."
Claire,Is Walt the one who's always skateboarding?No.
Luke,Where would he put his oxygen tank?
Claire,"Okay, now I'm really confused."
Luke,You sound like Walt. He gets confused a lot. It's hilarious.
Phil,"Wait, are we talking about Mr. Kleezak?"
Luke,"Yeah. I went over to his house to get my ball, and we've been hanging out."
Claire,"You were in Mr. Kleezak's house? Luke, that is not okay."
Luke,"Why not? He's really nice and funny. Listen to this joke. Okay, two krauts walk into a bar."
Claire,"Phil, this is not good."
Phil,"Honey, don't jump to conclusions. Let him finish the joke."
Luke,And one of them has a limp.
Phil,Uh-huh.
Claire,You may not go back to that man's house.
Luke,Why not?
Claire,Because... he's weird.
Phil,And not very nice.
Claire,Yeah.
Luke,That's what you said about my friend Oliver.
Claire,Oliver. Oliver who almost burned down our garage?
Luke,He likes to melt stuff. Like you're so perfect.
Phil,"Luke, I'm sorry, but your mother and I just aren't comfortable with this."
Luke,That's so unfair. You don't even know him 'cause you're too afraid to talk to him.
Phil,"Buddy, we're just looking out for you."
Luke,You never like any of my friends.
Claire,We're doing the right thing.
Phil,Absolutely. Aren't we?
Claire,"I don't know. I mean, he makes a point. We don't know the man, and little kids can be friends with old people, right?"
Phil,"Of course they can. There's tons of examples. ""Up,"" um, ""Gran Torino,"" ""True grit."""
Claire,"Cartoon, kills himself, she loses an arm. We've got to go talk to that guy."
Phil,Now?
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,It's so dark.
Cameron,"Okay, so, the numbers are by the phone. There's food in the fridge. I just changed her diaper, so all you need to do is put her down in about a half-hour and not let a serial killer in the front door."
Haley,"Well, what if he's cute?"
Mitchell,Then save him for us.
Cameron,"Nobody in, nobody out."
Haley,"Oh, we're gonna be totally fine. You just go get your gay on."
Mitchell,"Oh, it is on like Donkey Kong. Well, clearly it's not on yet, but it will be. So, okay, come on. Let's go."
Jay,"I'm telling you, kid, this is a concert you're never gonna forget. Mm-hmm. Greatest music in the world. Wait a minute. What's this?"
Gloria,What do you mean?
Jay,What are we seeing?
Gloria,"The symphony ""The four seasons."""
Jay,I thought we were seeing Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.
Manny,No.
Gloria,"No, it's Vivaldi."
Jay,"Oh, crap. You mean nothing but instruments? I'm out of here."
Gloria,"No, you're not out. You're in."
Jay,I hate this kind of music.
Gloria,"Jay, you always do that. Every time we try something new, your first reaction is always no."
Jay,It's 'cause I'm old enough to know what I like and what I don't like.
Manny,What about the crab cakes?
Jay,That was a fluke. And I can't slather that boring music in tartar sauce.
Manny,"So I have to try new things, like scrambled eggs, but you don't have to?"
Gloria,You see what you're doing? You're tearing this family apart.
Jay,Let's take it down a notch. You two go in. Have a great time. I'll see you later.
Gloria,What are you going to do?
Jay,"I'm gonna walk like a man, fast as I can, to that bar over there. And if you knew Frankie Valli, you'd be cracking up right now."
Gloria,It's okay.
Mitchell,"John Schneider, from ""The Dukes of Hazzard""?"
Cameron,That was your first crush?
Cameron,You had a shot with Montgomery Clift? How old are you?
Mitchell,"Oh, see, I miss this."
Mitchell,"Um, okay, well, I... I didn't know it was a crush because I was only 8 at the time."
Mitchell,"Okay, okay, back to me, back to me, back to me. So, I had just seen ""St. Elmo's fire,"" and..."
Cameron,"Oh, Mitchell, look, it's your father."
Mitchell,"Okay, can you please turn it off for one second?"
Mitchell,"Yeah, that's not something we're gonna do."
Mitchell,He doesn't know I'm this gay.
Cameron,Jay! Jay!
Mitchell,"Yes, please, keep this up. This is fun for me."
Jay,"Fellas, how you doing?"
Mitchell,"Hey, dad."
Cameron,"Hi, Jay."
Mitchell,What are you doing here?
Jay,I'm just getting a drink while Gloria and Manny see a show.
Jay,"No, I don't want to intrude."
Mitchell,He doesn't want to intrude.
Jay,I'm just gonna watch the game at the bar.
Mitchell,"He just wants to watch the game at the bar, so... Cameron ; Oh, sit down. We're up by 25 with a minute to go."
Jay,"Well, maybe just for a minute. Okay. So, what does a guy got to do to get a drink around here?"
Mitchell,Nobody say anything.
Mitchell,"No, no, I wasn't."
Jay,Your name is Longinus?
Jay,"Well, at least yours was gay. I mean, you might've had a shot."
Phil,He's right there.
Claire,All right.
Phil,Mr. Kleezak?
Claire,"Mr. Kleezak? It's open. Honey, he's not moving. Is he okay?"
Phil,"Well, there's only one way to find out."
Claire,"Mr. Kleezak? Mr. Kleezak? Okay, look. I... I don't know if he's breathing. Does he have a pulse?"
Phil,"Well, there's only one way to find out."
Claire,Would you stop pushing me? You do it.
Phil,"I hate this. I'm gonna kill Luke. Oh, my God. He's ice-cold."
Claire,"Oh, my God!"
Phil,Ugh!
Claire,I'm sorry. We thought there was something wrong with you.
Phil,Sorry.
Claire,We thought there was something wrong with you! Phil.
Phil,"Hi. We haven't, uh, formally met. Phil Dunphy."
Phil,No. No. We were just concerned that you looked dead. No offense.
Claire,"Oh, um, our son, Luke, told us that you invited him over here to watch movies, and I'm sure you could understand why we would... be concerned about that."
Claire,Phil.
Phil,You're doing great.
Claire,Honey.
Claire,No. Probably...Not.
Claire,"Okay. But in all fairness, our son is our business."
Claire,I...
Phil,"Oh, God, he's seen my sexy dance."
Jay,"So... I'm 12 years old, and I'm staying over night at my best friend Jim's house, and neither one of us want to go to sleep."
Jay,"You're better than that, Crispin."
Jay,"So, we sneak off to the movies, and we see this little picture called ""Solomon and Sheba."" And Sheba was..."
Cameron,Gina Lollobrigida!
Jay,"Bingo! And for the rest of my life, I swore, one day, I would marry Gina Lollobrigida."
Mitchell,"Well, dad, you kind of did."
Jay,Mmm. These are good. What's in them?
Jay,"Justin, more booze!"
Mitchell,Oh!
Cameron,"Haley, hi. Is... is everything okay?"
Haley,"Yeah, why?"
Cameron,Because I just saw a man walk through the living room.
Haley,What? Where are you?
Cameron,I can see through the camera on the computer.
Haley,"You're spying on me? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That is so lame. Look, I don't know what you think you saw... Maybe the TV, or the reflection, or maybe you think that my body's just shaped like a boy, like I don't have hips or something."
Cameron,"No, no, no, no. You have a... a darling figure. I was just concerned that..."
Haley,"That hurts so much. This is the kind of thing that I expect from my mother, but not from my cool uncle, so thank you for all of your trust."
Cameron,"Okay, I'm... sorry. Sorry."
Haley,Unbelievable. You got to go.
Mitchell,"Dad, I've never seen you sing before."
Jay,"Well, you never saw me in the shower. And don't anybody go there."
Mitchell,"When I was 12 years old, my father walked into my bedroom and caught me doing the most embarrassing thing that a boy can do... dancing to Madonna's ""Lucky star."" And from that moment on, there's always been a part of me that I've kept from him. And yet, yeah, here he was, you know, laughing with my friends. And... I don't know. Maybe the problem was me."
Mitchell,Rob Lowe.
Mitchell,"No, no, Rob Lowe from ""St. Elmo's fire."" That was... that was my crush. I loved him."
Jay,I get that. He was a good-looking kid.
Mitchell,Right?
Jay,"Yeah. Hey, ""Walk like a man""?"
Jay,Nurse!
Haley,Hello?
Haley,Why would I have your shoes?
Haley,What? How could you leave without your shoes?
Haley,This is a disaster!
Haley,They're gay. They know what shoes they own.
Luke,"Thanks a lot, Walt. You couldn't be nice to my parents for two seconds, so now I'm not allowed to hang out with you."
Luke,"I thought you were my friend. You promised to teach me how to grow tomatoes, and you were gonna take me for an egg cream."
Luke,"Oh, sorry I ""aggravated"" you. And, just so you know, a lot of people think I'm adorable."
Jay,I can't open this.
Manny,Maybe if you had gone to the concert instead...
Jay,"Could you open it, please?"
Manny,"I would, but I'm old enough to know that I don't like opening aspirin bottles."
Jay,Hello?
Mitchell,"Hey, dad!"
Jay,How do you guys do it?
Mitchell,"I thought cops could drink. Listen, I just... I wanted to say I had such a good time with you last night, and I wanted to..."
Jay,"Hey, hold on. I got call waiting. Yeah."
Jay,Who is this?
Jay,"Holy crap! That friend of yours, that Pepper. He's on his way over here. Why?"
Mitchell,"Well, you made a date with him last night. Don't you remember? Jay ; I think I would remember if I made a date with a guy!"
Jay,It's a date!
Jay,"I was drunk. I'm not going shopping with Priscilla, Queen of the desert."
Mitchell,"Okay, dad. Well, I'm feeling really good about our relationship, and I want to hold on to that for a little while longer, so I'm gonna go ahead and hang up with you. Give Pepper a big kiss for me."
Jay,"Gloria, now, listen. I know that you're upset with me about that concert thing, and rightfully so, but you have to help me."
Gloria,What is it?
Jay,It seems I made plans with Mitchell's friend Pepper.
Gloria,That's someone's name? Pepper?
Jay,"Yes, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's another guy named Longinus. But Pepper's gonna be here any second. He's gonna take me to Palm Springs to go shopping for records. Now, when he gets here, can you pretend there's some kind of an emergency? Can you do that, please?"
Gloria,"Ay, Jay! I... I think you'll have to take me now to the hospital. My head is in pain. Do you mean like that?"
Jay,"Yes, thank you. Okay, it's showtime. And with this guy, I mean that literally."
Jay,"Oh, okay. Um, Gloria, we're leaving!"
Gloria,"Hello. You must be Pepper. Ay, ay, ay. My head."
Jay,"What's the matter, Gloria?"
Gloria,"Oh, nothing. I just had a little ice cream. He hasn't stopped talking about you all day long."
Jay,Why...
Jay,"Are you sure you're all right, Gloria?"
Gloria,"I feel great, mi amor. I am so happy that he's doing this with you, because I never get him to do anything different, like the Vivaldi, hmm? I think he likes you more than me. You two have a great time together."
Jay,"All right, but we got to be back early, because, you know, I got that work thing."
Gloria,"No, no, I canceled everything. You don't have anything. You can spend all day long with him."
Claire,"Alex, honey, come on. We're gonna be late."
Alex,"A herd of cows dropped dead for no reason. I'm not going anywhere. Get your affairs in order, people. This is the end."
Phil,Don't be ridiculous. There's nothing out there to be afraid of. Hey!
Claire,Oh.
Phil,Oh!
Claire,Mr. Kleezak.
Claire,We're really sorry about that.
Phil,Wow. Thank you so much.
Claire,That is so nice.
Claire,Uh-huh. Okay?
Claire,"Sir, would you like to come in?"
Claire,"Maybe you could tell him yourself. He's... he's right upstairs. Hang on. Luke, honey, come on down! Your friend... Walt is here."
Phil,This is just so sweet.
Claire,Yeah.
Mitchell,"People can surprise you. You get used to thinking of them one way, stuck in their roles. They are what they are. And then they do something that shows you there's all this depth and dimension that you never knew existed."
Cameron,Are you talking about Rob Lowe?
Mitchell,I'm just saying he's a very versatile actor. I think his good looks have actually held him back.
Cameron,"Well, I can relate to that."
Cameron,Haley!
Haley,"We need to talk. I know I freaked out on you last night, but you have to see it from my point of view. You were totally spying on me."
Cameron,I know.
Haley,You were invading my first-amendment right to privacy.
Cameron,We were.
Haley,I'm sick and tired of people not trusting me.
Cameron,I get it.
Haley,"And especially you guys. I don't think of you guys as my uncles, I think of you as my friends. And if your friends don't believe in you, then what else do you have?"
Cameron,Dylan's shoes?
Haley,Please don't tell my mom.
Cameron,Buckle up.
Phil,"Excuse me, I'm so sorry. I never do this with celebrities, but are you by any chance the foxy mom on the New Horizon realty ad?"
Claire,Am I gonna regret doing that?
Phil,"Did the mobile man have any regrets? This ad is perfect. See, I'm not just selling houses, I'm selling myself, and the best part about me is my family. And my teeth. And both... are on display in this ad."
Claire,Mmm.
Luke,"""I can't be satisfied until you're satisfied""?"
Phil,"Coming soon to a bus bench near you, not to mention our minivan."
Claire,So that's really happening?
Haley,Wait. What's happening to our minivan?
Phil,Having this bad boy shrink-wrapped on it.
Luke,Classy.
Phil,Yep. Now all that driving around your mom does will serve a purpose.
Alex,"Good morning, family. How are you all doing on this beautiful day?"
Claire,Okay. What's this?
Alex,Haley's S.A.T. scores are available online.
Haley,I hate you.
Claire,"Oh! Today's the big day. Let's take a look, see how she did."
Haley,Do we really have to look at them now?
Phil,Don't worry. We're not expecting any miracles.
Haley,Thank you.
Claire,Are those Haley's scores? Are you sure?
Haley,Why? Are they bad?
Claire,"No, they're not bad."
Alex,Are they good?
Claire,"No, they're average. Sweetie, we did it. Our baby's average."
Phil,Medium five!
Claire,Oh.
Alex,This is just a fluke. She can take them again.
Claire,"Yeah, and she'll probably do even better. You are gonna have your choice of some pretty good colleges when the time comes."
Haley,If I go to college.
Claire,What?
Haley,"I've been thinking about it lately, and I might... not. Later!"
Alex,"Well, we took the scenic route, but we ended up in the same place."
Cameron,"From Zimbabwe to Algeria come on, let me hear ya these are the countries, these are the countries"
Mitchell,Cam recently became Franklin Middle School's interim musical director.
Cameron,"Go, Franklin! I was volunteering for their spring musical festival when their regular director suddenly and mysteriously became ill."
Cameron,"Oh, sorry."
Cameron,"It may have been a blessing. Their show lacked focus. I gave it a theme... ""A musical trip around the world."""
Mitchell,"Yeah, see, he focused it by making it about the world."
Cameron,You don't like it.
Mitchell,"No... Cam. I do. Do you... do you think that the kids, though, are gonna be able to learn it by tonight? I mean, maybe you should stick with something that they already know."
Cameron,I knew this would happen. Why do you have to throw a wet blanket on my dreams?
Mitchell,I do not.
Cameron,You do it all the time. And you know what I end up with? Wet dreams. I heard it as soon as I said it. Just leave it alone.
Mitchell,"All right, well, Cam, it's just that sometimes you can be a little, you know, overenthusiastic."
Cameron,Is it really that big of a deal that I want this to be the best show in the world?
Mitchell,"Well, as long as you heard me."
Cameron,Be in my corner. Don't be so critical.
Mitchell,We... is that really how you see me?
Cameron,"Sometimes, yeah, I do, Mitchell."
Mitchell,"Oh. Cam, well, if... if that's true, then I'm... I'm sorry. No, you know, okay, from now on, I am in your corner 100%. Yeah, that song is gonna knock everyone out."
Cameron,"Well, I don't know, but wait till you see the dance I have prepared."
Mitchell,A dance? A dance!
Gloria,"More toast, Manny?"
Manny,"Why won't you call me, Emma?"
Gloria,"More toast, Emma?"
Manny,Do you have to be on all the time?
Gloria,"Okay, I'm sorry. Who is this Emma?"
Manny,She's in the show with me tonight. I'm thinking of taking a run at her.
Gloria,"You don't ""take a run"" at a woman. You woo her. You make her feel special."
Jay,"Hey, hon, take a look at this. It's a picture of my butt."
Gloria,"And then when you get her, you can tell her whatever you want. Why do you do this?"
Jay,I programmed it so my butt pops up when my brother Donnie calls. It's a clever way of saying my brother's an ass.
Gloria,Is it?
Jay,That's him. Compose yourselves. Forget I showed you this picture.
Manny,I'm trying.
Jay,"How you doing, you dumb son of a bitch?"
Jay,"Oh, you too. What, are you eating your hair?"
Manny,"Hey, Uncle Donnie, are you coming to my school concert tonight?"
Jay,"It's an hour, tops."
Jay,"Hey, you know, I think I misplaced my phone. Could you call me on yours?"
Jay,"Oh, come on. It's simple."
Jay,I want the phone.
Jay,"Give me the phone, Donnie!"
Jay,"What? Is this all you got, huh?"
Gloria,"I don't understand this relationship, Emma."
Manny,"Hey, Emma. Doing this show, it feels like we've become like a little family, huh?"
Manny,"No. N... no, I don't!"
Luke,"Oh, no! They're back... dinosaur arms!"
Manny,"This isn't a good time, Luke."
Luke,"Half boy, half T-Rex. One foot in both worlds, wanted by neither."
Manny,"Luke, that's a great way to stretch out a shirt."
Cameron,"Okay, okay! Break's over, everyone! Let's take it from the top. Listen, we're running 20 minutes long, so we're gonna go ahead and cut the Bollywood number."
Cameron,"You know who else missed soccer practice, Delroy? The cast of ""Rent."" And now they have a Tony."
Luke,We have a Tony.
Manny,Seriously?
Claire,Hello?
Phil,"Hey, honey. Did they drop the van off yet?"
Claire,"Yeah, a little while ago."
Phil,How's it look?
Claire,"Uh, well, believe it or not, I have resisted the temptation to look. This whole Haley thing has got me a little preoccupied. We're on our way out to lunch right now."
Phil,"About that, I've been thinking, college is still a ways away. I say we leave Haley alone. The more we push, the more she'll push back."
Claire,I'm gonna push.
Phil,And I support that.
Haley,Only dad can make our minivan even lamer.
Claire,Excuse me. What are you doing?
Haley,I'm driving this thing to the reservoir. Just jump when I say jump.
Claire,"Honey, slide over."
Haley,How is this stupid ad supposed to sell houses anyway?
Claire,You heard your father. He's not just selling houses... he's selling us.
Haley,What are my friends gonna think?
Claire,They are gonna think that you're helping your father put food on the table.
Gloria,"Ay, is the chair broken?"
Jay,"Almost. That cheap, freeloading brother of mine can't keep his hands off my good scotch, so, you see, I placed that scotch there. My brother sits in this chair, goes out from under him... Bam! Masterpiece."
Gloria,So you make your brother fall and spill his drink?
Jay,"Well, I don't want to jinx it, but that's the plan."
Gloria,"Why are you both so mean? Where I come from, brothers respect each other. That's why Colombia is such a peaceful utopia."
Jay,"Hey, nice shirt. Do they sell men's clothes where you got that?"
Gloria,That's funny because women are so inferior.
Jay,Who's Melanie?
Gloria,How could you not know that your own brother had a granddaughter?
Jay,I probably knew.
Gloria,"How can you forget when he's family? I have 29 cousins, and I know them all... Rosa Marina, Gloria Maria, Veronica Maria, Jose Vicente..."
Jay,"Okay, okay, okay. What's your point?"
Gloria,"You do the chair, you do the fighting, but you don't know each other. It's sad."
Jay,"Look, I may not talk to my brother the way you talk to your sisters, but believe me, we're close in our own way."
Gloria,When was the last time that you saw him?
Jay,"Well, that's not easy, 'cause he lives up... Huh. See, I want to say Buffalo."
Claire,All I'm saying is that there's no downside to more education.
Haley,I knew this car ride was a trap.
Claire,See that? That right there shows me just how smart you are. Really? Again? What is going on?
Haley,"It's the stupid ad. They're honking on my side, too."
Claire,"Oh. Yes, we're the people in the ad. Yeah. Hi. Hey. Another great thing about college... complete independence."
Haley,I'd have that in an apartment.
Claire,"No, because to have an apartment, you would need a job. You want to know what your job is in college? It's a little bit of class and homework and it's a whole lot of new friends and experiences and the boys think you're cute and you are cute, and, oh, trust me, that doesn't last forever. Call the number!"
Jay,"First time for everything. You break. So, how's work?"
Jay,Nice break.
Jay,"Right, right. Seriously, though, how are things going with you?"
Jay,"Donnie, I'm trying to talk to you."
Jay,"Why? 'Cause that's what people do. Talk about things, like their lives."
Jay,What?
Jay,"Caught what early? Donnie, are you talking about... cancer?"
Jay,I can't believe you didn't tell me this.
Claire,"And there's frisbee golf, and... and you go snow-sledding on cafeteria trays. Oh, and you all get a dog together. I don't really know who takes care of the dog during the summer, but he's there when you get back."
Haley,"Geez, maybe you should just go back to college."
Claire,"Oh, honey, do you know what I would give to go back? It's this moment when your whole life is in front of you, and it's a magical time. You don't want to miss that, because when it's gone, it's gone."
Haley,"Yeah, yeah."
Phil,"Come on, Alex. Bus is leaving."
Alex,"Dad, your phone's been buzzing like crazy."
Phil,"Sweet Lorna Doone! 19 missed calls? I wonder who's... Phil Dunphy. You saw the ad? Great. Do you know what you're looking for? The little one? I think I know which one you're talking about. Um, if you're interested, I also have an older model with a lot of character. What? I think the carpet matches the drapes. I haven't checked in a while. Both of them? Wow. Well, I guess that makes sense if you're planning to flip one. Listen, um, why don't I call you back? We'll set up an appointment. It'll give me a chance to give them both a good scrubbing. All right. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. How about that, huh? You think all these calls are about the ad?"
Alex,Yeah. My friend Nicole just sent me a picture of the van.
Phil,I guess I'll be seeing you Wednesdays and every other weekend.
Claire,Hello?
Phil,"Okay, um, you sound very angry, which is completely understandable."
Claire,I'm not angry. I'm just sitting here thinking about college and how life has passed me by.
Phil,"Oh, thank God. I'll see you at the show. Love you. Bye. We got to go."
Cameron,"And as the music swells, we reveal our letters spelling ""we love the world."" Powerful stuff. And then the majestic Franklin Middle School insignia will drop into position if Reuben ever finishes painting it. It's not the Sistine Chapel, Reuben."
Mitchell,Surprise! Hey! Your supportive boyfriend dropped by to bring you a snack. P.B. and J.
Cameron,"Pear, brie, and jambon. My favorite! Okay, people, let's take five. A true five."
Mitchell,"Hey, Manny. How's it going?"
Manny,"Good, great, couldn't be better. Can we, uh..."
Mitchell,"Yes, we can, uh... all right."
Mitchell,What's up?
Manny,"Okay, you got to talk to Cam. He's driving us crazy. Kevin is biting his nails again, and Reuben hasn't had a bowel movement in a week. Don't laugh. That's how Elvis died."
Mitchell,"All right, um, Manny, I... I can't get involved. But... all right, if you have to say something, just tell Bob Fussy that he's overdoing it and you want to go back to your old stuff."
Cameron,"Okay, break's over, people! I want to do the French Revolution number again. Let's bring out the guillotine. Carefully this time."
Manny,"No, no, no."
Cameron,Excuse me?
Manny,"We don't want to do the new stuff. We want to stop rehearsing and go back to the old way, Bob Fussy."
Mitchell,I... I don't know where this is coming from.
Cameron,You all feel this way?
Cameron,"Well, I had no idea. I had no idea I was surrounded by a bunch of quitters. This production was a joke until I introduced these children to the musical-theater greats... Bernstein, Sondheim. Years from now, some of these kids will still be talking about the way I Sondheim-ized them."
Mitchell,"Ooh, I'm don't think that's a good way of saying... okay."
Cameron,"You want to do it the old way with the same tired songs, the same drab choreography, the same tepid applause from mom and dad? Is that what you want? Just say the word."
Cameron,"Well, too bad, people! We're doing it my way! From the top! This is a closed rehearsal. March."
Claire,"Hi, honey. What are you doing out here?"
Phil,"Oh, just waiting for you 'cause I love you. Haley, come out this side."
Haley,Why?
Phil,"'Cause it's fun. Try it. Yeah, the doors slide, the seats slide. What can't the Sienna do?"
Haley,That was fun.
Phil,Right? Let's go see a show!
Claire,"Sweetie, we need to close the door."
Phil,"Yeah, with the key. I like to see how far I can get from the car and still make it work."
Claire,"Listen, honey, honey."
Phil,Yeah?
Claire,"Let me ask you something. Okay, I need you to be really honest with me."
Phil,"Yeah, you ca... yes."
Claire,Are my best years behind me?
Phil,What? No. The trick is to keep looking forward. Here we go.
Claire,Really?
Phil,"Yes, yes, for sure."
Claire,You feel good?
Phil,"Yeah, I..."
Cameron,"Hello, and welcome, everyone. And latecomers. I hope you enjoy the show tonight. I think you will agree it has a certain flair that has been lacking from this stage in years past. So, please, I invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy this musical trip around the world!"
Luke,"Wow. Growing up in America sure is great, but I wish I knew more about the world."
Luke,"I think I've got an idea. See you later, friend."
Luke,To see the world! China looks interesting. I think I'll land here.
Cameron,Bring him down! Bring him down! Just go with it. Hit it!
Jay,"Sorry, folks. Nice. He taped it shut."
Gloria,"Okay, that's enough. Ay! Stupid! You too!"
Jay,Don't hit him. He has cancer.
Gloria,What...
Claire,"Oh, my God, is Luke stuck up there? Phil?"
Phil,"Come on. Yeah. Ye... oh, no. Come on!"
Luke,"China sure was fun. And look, there's merry old England."
Alex,Has anyone here ever seen a globe?
Manny,Full steam ahead! Ahead!
Cameron,Just sing.
Manny,"Oh, joy to salt-swept eyes fair England, do I see..."
Jay,"Sorry about what I said to Gloria, okay? Just came out. Let's go back inside."
Jay,What?
Jay,"I'm not gonna hit you, Donnie."
Jay,"I'm sorry. I feel a little bad for you, okay? I know we don't say this much, but, uh... I care for you, you know?"
Jay,What was that he said again?
Jay,"""I can't hear no more!"" Oh, Don."
Mitchell,"Your staging is all over the place. The kids are exhausted. You're making it all about you. No intermission. What, are we animals? I..."
Jay,"Good for you. You promise me you'll get that liver checked out. Ah, there's nothing wr... Come on, Donna. Suck it up. We're missing my kid's show."
Cameron,"Okay, all right. That one was my fault, but Joan of Arc's gonna be just fine."
Manny,It's not gonna be much fun doing the show without Emma.
Cameron,No. No. There is a saying in the theater world that...
Manny,"""It's not worth dying for""?"
Cameron,"No, it's that ""endings make shows."" And we've got a great ending. Now get out there and sing your hearts out. Oh, not you, sweetie. You just mouth the words. Okay."
Luke,"Uncle Cam, both my legs are tingly."
Cameron,"Okay, we'll cut you down in just a second, Luke, okay? The show must go on. Have fun with it."
Luke,"Learning about the world sure was fun. But I'm glad to have my feet back on the ground again. Oh, Egypt is a land where the pyramids stand which were built by industrious Jews and windmills go around in Holland town where they all wear wooden shoes these are the things we learned today and there's one last thing we want to say"
Claire,"""We love the word"""
Cameron,"Where's the ""L""?"
Manny,That's Luke.
Cameron,Lower the insignia. Lower it.
Jay,"""We love the... "" What the hell?"
Cameron,"No, no, no. No, no. No, no, no. No. No, no, no. No."
Mitchell,Brava!
Claire,"Phil, where have you been?"
Phil,"Oh, just getting some fresh air."
Claire,Honey.
Phil,"Got it. Ready to go? Hey, look up at the moon. Would you say that's waxing or waning? Who cares? We can spend all night looking..."
Claire,"""I can't be satisfied""?! My God, Phil. That makes me look like a prostitute."
Phil,No.
Claire,"Yes. Yes, it does."
Phil,"More of an escort, really. You're just selling your time. Whereas a prostitute just..."
Claire,"Okay, Phil. I have been driving around in this all day."
Phil,"Well, since you're mad already, why don't you just step over here and have a look at that?"
Claire,"Oh, God. My baby."
Haley,I am not getting back in that car!
Claire,"Oh, how do you think you're gonna get home, honey?"
Haley,It doesn't matter! I'll go home with anyone!
Alex,That's what it should say on the van.
Claire,Alex. I can't believe we trusted you to put this on the car after the debacle of that last picture.
Phil,Damn it.
Claire,And that... who was that?
Phil,Probably another...
Alex,"I think the word you're looking for is ""John."""
Claire,Get in the minivan. You mean to tell me that people have actually been calling about this?
Phil,There are a lot of creeps out there.
Claire,That's disgusting. She's a child.
Phil,"Well, to be fair, most of them were for you."
Claire,"Well, it's still sick. What do you mean, ""most""?"
Phil,"Well, I don't know. There were 30 calls. You got 20 or 25 of them."
Claire,And they... ask for me?
Phil,They asked for the hot blonde.
Claire,Hmm. Men are pigs. Did they call me anything else?
Claire,"So, thanks to all the perverts in town, I realized I still have a few good years ahead of me."
Phil,"And if we have one person to thank for that, it would be me."
Claire,No.
Cameron,Was it as awful as I think?
Mitchell,Take the flowers.
Cameron,It must have been really hard for you to be supportive while I made a fool out of myself.
Mitchell,"Oh, come here. Luke, do you mind? We're trying to have a moment here."
Luke,I can feel my heartbeat in my eyes.
Cameron,In his eyes?
Mitchell,Yes. Okay. We'll get a janitor.
Cameron,Okay.
Jay,Want some coffee?
Manny,"Say yes. It's French press. I was doubtful, too, but I honestly can't see myself going back to drip."
Jay,I'm so happy you don't live in a tough neighborhood anymore.
Mitchell,We're so sorry for just dropping by like this.
Gloria,"Are you kidding me? I'll take any chance to spend time with this little princess. I love her little hair, her little toes."
Cameron,And she loves her grandmother.
Gloria,"I don't love ""grandmother."""
Mitchell,"So, Cam and I have been revising our will to specify who should take care of Lily if, God forbid, something happened to us."
Cameron,God forbid.
Mitchell,"I said ""God for..."" So, we've been dropping by unannounced to, you know, casually assess our candidates."
Cameron,"Not all of our candidates. Mitchell ! No, t... that's true. We did not drop by Missour-ah."
Cameron,"It's ""Missouri."" No one from Missouri would say ""Missour-ah."""
Mitchell,"I'm so sorr-ah. So, anyway, Claire and Phil were our first thought, so we dropped by their place last week."
Haley,You win the award for worst mother ever!
Claire,"I will be sure to thank you in my speech! Phil, the frying pan's on fire!"
Phil,Son of Jor-El! Everybody stay calm!
Luke,"Dad, I'm gonna teach myself how to juggle."
Phil,"Good for you, buddy."
Alex,Mom! No one heard me screaming?! I've been trapped in the garage for like 20 minutes!
Claire,And yet still you didn't get the rat traps I sent you for.
Alex,Oh!
Claire,"Thank you. Honey, it's doing it again!"
Phil,"Come on, now! Every morning?!"
Haley,I hope the whole house burns down!
Mitchell,Did we come at a bad time?
Claire,"Come back in seven years and five months, when they're all gone!"
Cameron,"So, mama, you're good for coal?! Okay, okay! Well, you bundle up! We don't want to lose you! Okay. Yeah, bye! They're in the middle of a terrible blizzard."
Jay,So you shouted!
Manny,Did they really lose two cows?
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, frozen solid. Mama's gonna send pictures."
Mitchell,"Oh, yay, a reason to stop by the frame store."
Jay,"Manny, I got to get you down to that sporting-goods place. Got to get him some stuff for his weekend outing."
Manny,Ready!
Jay,Did you pee?
Manny,Not ready.
Cameron,"Jay, would you mind if we came?"
Jay,"Sure, why not?"
Cameron,"You know, I'd like to get mama some snowshoes... You know, to lift her spirits, what with all the frozen cows and all."
Mitchell,"So, cows freeze now? Are we all just accepting that?"
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, absolutely. Jay, this one time..."
Jay,We'll take two cars.
Gloria,"If you want, I can stay with the little princess."
Mitchell,"Oh, that... that's a great idea."
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, I'll just... I'll just go out and get her bag."
Gloria,"Maybe I can take her to the mall, buy her a new outfit, get her some hair rings... Is that okay?"
Mitchell,"Yes, yes, of course. Um, you know, Gloria, Cam and I were talking about what would happen to Lily if anything were ever to happen to us, and we were thinking..."
Gloria,"Oh, my God. ¡sí, sí, sí! I take her!"
Mitchell,"Okay, well, that's very sweet, but you realize it would only happen..."
Gloria,I can't wait!
Mitchell,"Okay, well, hopefully, it's a long shot."
Gloria,"Ay, a little girl!"
Mitchell,There would have to be a very tragic accident.
Gloria,"I know, I know. Nothing is going to happen."
Mitchell,Oh.
Gloria,"But if it did, we would be so happy! ¡Ay!"
Phil,"So, what do you say, pal? I got to swing by the office. You want to come along?"
Claire,Can't. We got some stuff to do.
Phil,What?
Claire,Just errands.
Phil,Oh.
Claire,"I'm taking Luke to see a child psychologist. This is something that Phil would never agree to. He's doesn't want Luke to feel... different. But Luke's grades aren't great, and he's having trouble concentrating in school. I just want to make sure that he's... normal."
Luke,"Hey, mom, check it out."
Claire,What are you doing?
Luke,"If I move my head fast enough, it looks like the can is standing still."
Claire,'Cause sometimes I wonder.
Phil,"But all the girls at work love it when I bring Luke by, especially that receptionist Heather, right, buddy?"
Luke,She smells amazing.
Claire,"Mm. Well, honey, you're gonna have to smell daddy's receptionist some other time."
Luke,Like peaches.
Claire,"If you're both going out, who's taking me to cello?"
Luke,"One time, she gave me a Woody."
Claire,Sweet Je...
Luke,"She remembered he's my favorite character from ""Toy Story."""
Claire,"She did. Uh... Haley, how are you getting to the mall?"
Haley,"Uh, Gabby's picking me up."
Claire,"Okay, you're gonna drop your sister off at her cello lesson first."
Haley,No way. She plays lacrosse and takes cello lessons. Even my reputation can't handle that dork hit.
Claire,"Okay, well, then you don't need to go snowboarding with your friends on break."
Haley,"Fine, I'll take her. Just never look my friends in the eye, and only speak in emergencies."
Alex,Got it.
Haley,Ah! Already failed.
Phil,"Honey, after I go by the office, maybe we can grab some lunch."
Claire,"Oh, I can't. I got to pick up all that stuff for the school trip. But you know what? I'll see you tonight at dad and Gloria's."
Phil,Okay.
Luke,Smell Heather for me.
Phil,I always do... not.
Claire,"Hi, Dr. Klausner. I am so sorry we're late. We just got a little bit caught up in..."
Phil,"Hello, Claire."
Phil,"Go get 'em, pal."
Claire,How did you...
Phil,"How did I what? Know you were someplace you left no trace of except for a tiny notation in your calendar? It was quite simple, really. I noticed a tiny nota... Shoot."
Alex,That's weird. My cello teacher's car's in here. I wonder if she's not home.
Haley,"Okay, so go knock on the door, Alan Einstein."
Alex,"Don't leave. And it's ""Albert."""
Haley,I know. Alan's his dorky brother who played the cello.
Alex,Good one.
Haley,What?
Haley,Tell me.
Haley,No! But she's so nice to me.
Haley,"Well, now she's gonna see how we play. What are we gonna do?"
Alex,She's not there. You're just gonna have to take me home.
Haley,We don't have time. We have stuff to do.
Alex,Then I'm just gonna have to come with you.
Haley,"What, so she gets kidnapped and I get in trouble? No, thank you. Okay, fine, you can come with us, but you have to keep your mouth shut about anything you see."
Haley,Just drive!
Cameron,"Ooh, maybe I should also get a gift for my aunt Pat. Have I ever told you about her? Total gun nut, lives completely off the grid."
Mitchell,Did you see how cute Gloria was with Lily?
Cameron,"Oh, Pat is hilarious. I don't think she's paid taxes in 20 years, but very hospitable. Always has a deer in the freezer."
Mitchell,Would you listen to me? I think that Gloria and my dad could be Lily's guardians.
Cameron,"Look, you know I love Jay, and they're still in the mix, but I just don't know about him raising a child."
Mitchell,"Well, Cam, he raised me."
Cameron,"Well, now you've put me in an awkward position. Oh, look at that. That's adorable."
Jay,Let's see if we can get you some snow pants.
Manny,I just wish I felt better. I think I'm coming down with flu- like symptoms.
Jay,"Couple of hours before your camping trip, huh?"
Manny,"I want to go. It's just, if I'm sick, I might get the chaperones sick, and without chaperones, it's anarchy."
Jay,"Manny, listen to me."
Manny,"The buddy system falls apart, the principle of ""last in, first out"" is ignored."
Jay,It's butterflies.
Manny,Where?
Jay,"You're just nervous because there's gonna be a lot of physical activity, which is not exactly your strong suit."
Manny,It is a little daunting out there.
Jay,"D... don't use the word ""daunting"" in nature, okay? You just need a little self-confidence. Look at this. They got one of these rock walls here. Why don't you hop up on that?"
Manny,Why?
Jay,"Why? To prove that you can do it. If you can do that, you can do anything."
Manny,Really? Can I fly? Can I speak Chinese?
Jay,"No, but you can sleep in the house tonight. Ace? Want to wire my boy up, here? Go ahead."
Claire,I'm sorry I went behind your back. But you get so defensive whenever we talk about Luke's issues.
Phil,He doesn't have issues. You're just a worrier. Like when you thought he was never gonna talk.
Claire,"He was 2, and all he could do was bark!"
Phil,I understood him.
Claire,Phil!
Phil,"Look, he starts coming here, the other kids find out, he becomes a target, like that limping gazelle at the watering hole that the alligator knows to eat."
Claire,"They're crocodiles, not alligators. There are no alligators in Africa."
Phil,How about at the zoo? Bam! Who needs a shrink now?
Claire,Yes? Hi.
Luke,"Okay. She's, like, the best doctor ever. A couple of puzzles, no shots. I didn't even have to take my pants off. Found that one out a little late."
Phil,"I've been there, buddy."
Claire,Mwah!
Phil,Awesome. Thanks so much for your time.
Claire,We... we would love to hear your thoughts.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,Mm-hmm.
Claire,"Mm-hmm. Phil, honey, I want you to hear this."
Claire,Makes me crazy.
Phil,Too crazy.
Claire,What if they don't?
Claire,"Is there any way to avoid that bridge altogether? You know, maybe there's diet or... or focusing exercises or something?"
Phil,Get comfortable.
Claire,"I'm worried he's turning into you, Phil."
Claire,"I knew the minute I opened my mouth that I was in the wrong, but, honestly, sometimes I wonder about him."
Luke,"Hey, mom, check it out."
Claire,What are you doing?
Luke,"If I move my head fast enough, it looks like the can is standing still."
Phil,He's totally right!
Cameron,"I just find it interesting that you blame Jay for everything from your night terrors to your shy bladder, and now he's the perfect guardian for Lily."
Mitchell,"No, not perfect, and... and I never said anything about my shy bladder."
Cameron,O... oh. Then why did I have to stand guard outside the bathroom at Pepper's three faces of new year's Eve party?
Jay,"Damn it, Manny! Move it! Go!"
Manny,It's scary.
Jay,You're 2 feet off the ground. I've seen vines climb walls faster than that. Move your butt!
Cameron,"Oh, well, there's your esteem-building parent right there. Wait, wait, I think I hear future Lily sending us a message from her stripper pole... ""Thanks, gay dead dads. This dance is for you."" Excuse me, Jay?"
Manny,I'm getting down.
Jay,Not till you touch the top! What is it?
Cameron,"Well, maybe if we didn't bully Manny so much, but, rather, showed him, he wouldn't be so afraid. Excuse me, sherpa, can you assist me with the harness?"
Phil,"Oh, no. Which one of these is my driving machine?"
Claire,"Phil, I already apologized. It just... it came out wrong."
Phil,"Funny, I thought that was my problem... I came out wrong. Hold on. Oh, good, I can walk again."
Claire,"Honey, you know, sometimes you can act a little bit..."
Phil,"Oh, no! Where did everyone go?! Oh, just a blink."
Claire,"Phil, when you are ready to talk to me like an adult, why don't you let me know?"
Phil,"Fine. Okay, okay. The adults are the big ones, right?"
Luke,"Hey, how do you think that got up there? Uh-oh."
Cameron,"Now, I know it seems daunting, Manny, but it's very simple. I'm securely hitched to a rope, which means I'm not going to fall."
Mitchell,"You know, dad, you're really making my life difficult right now."
Jay,How?
Mitchell,By barking at Manny like a drill sergeant when I'm trying to convince Cam that you'd be a great guardian for Lily.
Jay,Guardian?
Mitchell,Yeah.
Jay,You're kidding.
Cameron,Aah! Jay!
Mitchell,"Yeah, never mind."
Cameron,That really hurt!
Alex,This is a mistake.
Haley,Because they're the first words she ever heard.
Haley,This will teach that skank a lesson.
Alex,Shaving cream in her locker?
Haley,Just stand over there and yell if someone's coming.
Alex,She might have homework assignments in there she hasn't handed in yet. Haley! Someone's coming!
Haley,"Run! This way, this way!"
Alex,"Okay, okay, okay! Where are we?"
Haley,Boys' locker room.
Alex,It smells like feet.
Haley,That's not feet. Okay.
Alex,I'm so scared.
Haley,Just go to your happy place.
Alex,We just broke into my happy place.
Haley,"Shh, shh, shh, shh! Go, go, run, run! Not so loud! Run! Run!"
Mitchell,"So, how you doing?"
Cameron,"Oh, not good. I'm just glad my clown training prepared me to take a fall like that."
Mitchell,"Yeah, and in terms of talking about it, are we looking at weeks, months?"
Cameron,"Do not minimize it, you, who I had to rush to the emergency room that time you fell out of your clogs."
Jay,There's your bubbly water with lemon.
Cameron,"Thank you, Jay."
Jay,How you doin'?
Cameron,"Oh, it's hard to tell. You know, anytime you have a catastrophic injury to your lumbar area..."
Jay,I could use a little piece of lumbar myself right now.
Cameron,"Well, I hope you're comfortable now making my family Lily's guardians."
Gloria,"¡Hola, hola!"
Mitchell,You're forgetting about Gloria. Even you have to admit how amazing she is with Lily.
Gloria,Mm! Look who's so pretty!
Cameron,"Oh, my God!"
Mitchell,"Gloria, what did you do?"
Gloria,What I told you.
Cameron,You pierced her ears?!
Gloria,What I said... I was going to make her pretty with earrings.
Mitchell,"I thought you said ""hair rings."""
Gloria,What are hair rings?
Cameron,"Yes, Mitchell, what are hair rings?"
Mitchell,Something that you would tie your hair back... She said it!
Gloria,"I didn't say ""hair rings."" I said ""earrings."" You don't like?"
Cameron,Of course not. You punctured our daughter! Oh!
Gloria,But did you see both sides? I didn't just do the gay ear. Look.
Mitchell,"Oh, my God."
Haley,"I actually... I think we're good. Let's just wait in here for Gabby, okay?"
Alex,"Oh, my God! I can't believe we just did that. Can you believe we just did that?"
Haley,"Yeah, we had a lot of fun. Let's not geek it up."
Alex,Wait. What if I have a taste for it now? Am I gonna start doing stuff like that all the time?
Haley,Calm down. You just did one bad thing.
Alex,Two. I skipped my cello lesson today. That wasn't even where my teacher lives.
Haley,You ditched a class?
Alex,"Well, I... I didn't have time to practice because of lacrosse and debate team and..."
Haley,Do you even like playing the cello?
Alex,Yeah.
Haley,Alex?
Alex,I hate it.
Haley,So quit.
Alex,I've never quit anything.
Haley,You've never broke into a school before. Just did that.
Alex,"No offense, but the family's hopes and dreams are kind of pinned on me."
Haley,"I'm just saying that no one would blame you if you stopped being so perfect. It actually would take a lot of pressure off of me. I did something bad, too... Something that nobody knows."
Alex,What?
Haley,"Come here. I can't say it too loud, okay?"
Alex,What did you do?
Claire,"Phil, I'm just not sure you understand why I said what I said."
Phil,"There are qualities about me you wish you could change, but you can't 'cause I'm all grown up, but it's not too late for Luke."
Claire,"Okay. Honey, there are a hundred things about Luke that he gets from you that I absolutely love. It's just this... this one tiny part that I'm sure if I could just get in there and just... ee!"
Phil,Claire... he's a great kid. He's gonna be fine.
Claire,I know. I think I know. I feel terrible that we fought in front of him. Did he say anything about that on the drive here?
Phil,How would I know? He rode with you.
Claire,He didn't drive with me. He drove with you.
Cameron,Just admit it... you want Lily raised by anyone but my family.
Mitchell,It's just so far away from everything she knows. And then there's the crazy aunts and the frozen cows.
Cameron,"Oh, please, in the last hour, your father publicly shamed Manny, dropped me from the sky, while his wife drilled holes in our baby's head. Oh!"
Mitchell,Which is why I think we should revisit Claire and Phil.
Claire,Where are my keys?
Phil,We left Luke alone in a parking garage!
Mitchell,We don't know the whole story.
Cameron,Don't we?
Phil,Whose car are we taking?
Claire,Mine.
Phil,Then I'm driving!
Luke,"Hey, mom."
Phil,Buddy!
Claire,Luke?
Phil,Buddy! Lukey?
Claire,"Thank you so much. Honey, get out of there."
Phil,Thank you! I'm so sorry.
Claire,We are so sorry.
Phil,"Oh, buddy, you must've been so scared."
Luke,No.
Claire,"Oh, God."
Phil,"Well, what happened?"
Luke,"Well, I knew you'd come back. Then you didn't. So I had to go find a phone. That's when I saw a stray dog and I played with him for a while. Then I thought I saw Mrs. Morgan, my first-grade teacher, going into a church. It wasn't her, but there was a wedding there. That's where I met the Litvaks."
Phil,"Oh, thank you! Thank you so much. Congratul... tov. Mwah!"
Claire,"Oh, baby."
Luke,Can I go get a drink?
Claire,"Yes, you can."
Phil,"Yes, you can! You can drink whatever you want! Of course you can. There's tons of soda in there. Ohh!"
Claire,"What an amazing kid! I can't believe I ever worried about him out in the world. That's what I do, though, isn't it? I worry. I worry... I think about a tiny, little thing, and then I obsess on it, until, suddenly, it's the only thing I can think about. God, please don't let me screw up our son."
Phil,"Hey, hey. You know why else he's gonna be okay?"
Claire,No.
Phil,"Because somewhere out there is a worried little girl who's making lists and labeling bins, and he's gonna find her."
Manny,Cam? I know you're kind of down on Jay being Lily's guardian.
Cameron,"Now, that's not anything you need to worry about, Manny."
Manny,I just think you're being too hard on him. We had a little chat in the car.
Manny,"I'm sorry I let you down, Jay. I'm starting to think if I couldn't even get up that wall, then why am I even going on this..."
Jay,"Knock it off, Manny. We both know you could get up that wall. Now, why are you trying to get out of this trip?"
Manny,I'm not. I'm excited to go...
Jay,Manny...
Manny,Okay. I have some concerns about the shower situation.
Jay,Oh. Because?
Manny,"Well, I'm pretty much at my target weight."
Jay,That's good.
Manny,"But the thing is, I haven't quite reached my target height."
Jay,"All right, first of all, you don't have to go. I'll write you a note. We'll plan on doing something fun this weekend."
Manny,Really?
Jay,You bet.
Manny,And you're not mad at me?
Jay,"Look, if you were a different kid, I'd give you the speech... You know, ""we all have insecurities. You've got to be brave here."" But let's face it... you're already about the bravest kid I know."
Manny,I am?
Jay,"Come on. You wear blazers to school. You play the pan flute. You... you read poetry to girls. I couldn't even talk to girls when I was your age. The shower thing's nothing compared to all that. So, whatever you decide, I'm behind you. No, I got that set up just right. I told you about that before."
Cameron,Jay said that?
Manny,"Yeah, and he wasn't drinking or anything."
Cameron,"So, what are you gonna do?"
Manny,"I think I'm gonna go. I mean, if Reuben can go with that extra nipple..."
Cameron,"I'm proud of you, Manny. You're doing the right thing, trust me."
Mitchell,"I mean, what were you thinking, Gloria?"
Gloria,"Ay, Mitch, I said I was sorry. But I had them since I was 2... huge ones."
Phil,What is she...
Claire,"Earrings, Phil. Earrings."
Jay,"Mitch, I just wanted to tell you how really touched I was you'd want me to be Lily's guardian."
Mitchell,"Oh, you're welcome. And you're out."
Cameron,Excuse me. I have a very important announcement to make.
Phil,"Oh. Sorry. Sorry, so rude. Totally inexcusable. Yello!"
Cameron,"Mitchell and I have decided that if, God forbid, anything should happen to us..."
Mitchell,You don't have to do this right now.
Cameron,No. We would like to Jay and Gloria to be Lily's guardians.
Mitchell,Cam?
Cameron,It's the right decision.
Gloria,"That is great news! Lily, when something horrible happens, you're going to be all mine!"
Mitchell,"It really is an ""if"" situation."
Gloria,All mine!
Claire,"I don't mean to ruin this really beautiful moment, but were Phil and I even considered for the position?"
Phil,Claire?
Claire,"I mean, we are the parents of three healthy, well-adjusted children who..."
Phil,"Honey, we need to go down to the police station. Our daughters just vandalized the school."
Claire,This is not over.
Gloria,"Let's go see your new room, Liliana."
Mitchell,"No, that's not her name."
Mitchell,Hey.
Cameron,"Oh, hey, what are you doing home?"
Mitchell,"Oh, I bailed on yoga."
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, could you go to the mailbox and get me..."
Mitchell,"No, why can't I just come in?"
Cameron,You can. I just...
Mitchell,Cameron?
Cameron,What?
Mitchell,Look at me.
Cameron,I am.
Mitchell,What did you do?
Cameron,I am home alone for a lot of hours.
Mitchell,Carmen Miranda?
Cameron,I just wanted a couple before the holes closed up.
Mitchell,"Oh, Cameron. Oh. All right, just get one with me really quick."
Cameron,Okay. All right. Hey! One for daddy! Whoo!
Phil,Okay. Here she comes.
Haley,What are you wearing?
Claire,You don't remember this shirt? You made it for me for mother's day in kindergarten. It's adorable.
Haley,It's perverted. It looks like you were felt up by that creepy guy around the corner.
Alex,Ew! Why him?
Haley,"'Cause he's got, like, freakishly tiny hands."
Phil,Thank you!
Haley,I cannot believe you kept that shirt.
Claire,Of course I kept it. I'm your mother. I keep everything you make me.
Alex,Please take that off.
Claire,"Oh, when I'm dead. Today is my special day, and I am gonna enjoy me some coffee."
Luke,"You know that's a pencil holder, right?"
Claire,"Oh, I do now."
Jay,Go first.
Manny,"No, you can go first."
Jay,"Manny, go first!"
Manny,"No, Jay, you go first."
Gloria,"Ah, somebody give me a present! Oh, Jay, a diamond necklace! Thank you!"
Jay,"You deserve it. Go ahead, kid."
Manny,"Happy mother's day, mom."
Gloria,Oh. A necklace made of the froot loops! I love it!
Manny,"I know they're not exactly diamonds, mom."
Gloria,"No, they're beautiful."
Jay,"You know what? I got a confession to make. Those aren't real diamonds. No. Here, give them back. I'll get you some real ones later."
Manny,Dang it. Now I got to come clean. These aren't real froot loops. They're generic.
Gloria,Hey. Now I have no presents again.
Mitchell,Good morning!
Cameron,"He-e-e-y! Hey, what's this?"
Mitchell,"Well, I know you've had some late nights with Lily, and this is just my way of saying ""thank you"" and ""I love you."""
Cameron,"Oh, thank you."
Mitchell,"And this is just the beginning. Yeah, 'cause today is your day."
Cameron,Today?
Mitchell,All day.
Cameron,Today. Today is my day.
Mitchell,Something's happening.
Cameron,"It mother's day, Mitchell."
Mitchell,So?
Cameron,You're bringing me breakfast in bed on mother's day.
Mitchell,"Okay, no, no, this is not a mother's day breakfast."
Cameron,This is breakfast that happens to be on... You think of me as Lily's mother! I'm your wife! I'm a woman!!
Mitchell,What?
Mitchell,"Honestly, I'm a little offended that he accused me of that. I'm actually very sensitive to that issue. Like I would ever treat my partner as a woman."
Claire,Somebody got new curtains.
Mitchell,"Well, Mrs. Pritchett loves to shop. Oh, we're never"
Mitchell,Sometimes I think he just wants to be mad at me.
Cameron,I can't eat!
Mitchell,"Okay, you know what? If you can't accept the nice gesture, then just forget it. Okay, scratch the balloons. She is in a mood."
Phil,"I asked Claire what she wanted for mother's day, and she said, ""take a hike."" It's not like that. She's... she's just bananas for walking around in nature. Um, so, she and... and Gloria are taking the kids up the canyon um, and Jay and I are, uh, throwing on the aprons and preparing a mother day feast. It's... it's gonna be fun."
Phil,♪ I know you want to leave me ♪ but I refuse to...
Jay,We're not doing that.
Luke,You know there are coyotes in these woods? Did you pack a weapon?
Manny,I have a walking stick.
Luke,Does it become a sword?
Manny,I guess it could become a running stick.
Luke,"All right, you're gonna outrun a coyote? The fastest mammal in the world?"
Manny,I'm not sure that's true. And how are you gonna fend them off with a popsicle stick?
Luke,"It's a spear. And it smells like lemon-lime, a flavor coyotes hate."
Manny,Where are you getting your information?
Alex,How much farther?
Claire,"Well, I'd like to go far enough that we can't still see our car in the parking lot."
Haley,I'm getting dust in my mouth.
Gloria,You have to appreciate nature.
Claire,Yes.
Gloria,"Soon, this will be the mall."
Haley,I'll come then.
Luke,I'm hungry. I say we eat what we kill.
Manny,"Oh, then I guess we'll be eating the mood."
Luke,I don't get you at all.
Manny,I know.
Alex,Ugh.
Mitchell,"Oh, is that the party over there?"
Cameron,"I don't know. I'm a woman, remember? I have a terrible sense of direction."
Mitchell,"May I remind you that my big crime was making you fluffy pancakes, okay? I'm getting a little sick of you dwelling on this. It happens to be mother's day, not martyr's day."
Cameron,Mitchell. I'm sorry. It's just a sensitive issue for me.
Mitchell,Okay.
Cameron,There's nothing gays hate more than when people... Treat us like women.
Mitchell,...treat us like women.
Cameron,We're not. We don't want to go to your baby shower. We don't have a time of the month. We don't love pink.
Mitchell,"Well, you love pink."
Cameron,"No, pink loves me."
Mitchell,Okay.
Mitchell,Hey! So...
Cameron,"That's Jen, husband Rick, baby Diego. I don't get it either."
Mitchell,"Hey, Jen. Let me help you with that."
Mitchell,Rick! How you doing?
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, because that makes all the sense in the world... you as the husband."
Mitchell,Stop it. That's not what she meant.
Cameron,Look at us. I could snap you like a twig.
Mitchell,"Okay, every once in a while you say that thing about the twig, and I need you to know that it bothers me."
Cameron,Sorry.
Cameron,"No, let's go. Let's get out of here. Leave the stroller and run."
Mitchell,"Cam, stop. No one's going to ask you to..."
Cameron,I don't know. You guys just go ahead.
Cameron,"Oh, I don't know. Uh, okay, all right. Unhand me."
Manny,"Yeah, that was definitely poison oak. I think this rash is spreading."
Gloria,"Manny, that's not a rash. It's red because you scratch it."
Manny,I just don't want my throat to close.
Luke,Wouldn't be the worst thing.
Haley,"I'm so bored, I'd rather be reading."
Alex,"I'm so bored, I chewed the last bug that flew in my mouth just to feel something."
Haley,"I'm so bored, I'm talking to you."
Claire,"Ugh! Okay! For the last 20 minutes, all you people have done is whine! You would think on mother's day, at least, you would have something nice to say..."
Luke,Shh!
Claire,What?
Luke,Thought I heard a coyote. Go ahead.
Alex,"God, Luke, you're such an idiot."
Luke,At least I don't look like an idiot.
Alex,What does that mean?
Haley,Your hat. It's like you walked under a bird that poops ugly hats.
Manny,Can we watch the language?
Haley,There's nothing else to watch.
Gloria,Enough complaining! You can't bitch all day because you're not at the beach all day. Come on.
Claire,"No. No, no. I-I'm giving myself a mother's day present. Kids, your hike is over."
Claire,"No! No, not happy. Bad. Sad. Mm. Gloria and I are gonna go finish this beautiful hike together while you sit here and think about how selfish and thoughtless you've been. Come on."
Alex,"If we're thoughtless, how can we think?"
Claire,You just lost your water. Let's go.
Jay,What the hell are those?
Phil,Onion goggles. No more tears when I cook. Welcome to the 21st century. You should get a pair.
Jay,I was gonna suggest the same thing.
Phil,"Hey, Jay, you know what we should put in this? We should add a da..."
Jay,"No. It's my mom's recipe. What it says on the page goes in the pot. Nothing more, nothing less. Now, how long do I stir the beef and sausages? Read it to me."
Phil,You should stir the beef and sausages for five minutes.
Jay,And how much longer do I have to listen to the Julia Child impression?
Phil,For as long as it's still funny.
Jay,I think the timer just went off on that.
Phil,"That was unnecessary. What's this? What?! Hey, Jay, maybe after this, we should make ""The perfect mom."" All we need is ""a tablespoon of love, 1 cup of warmth, add one heart, softened."""
Jay,What the hell are you talking about?
Phil,"This recipe for the perfect mom, by Jay Francis Pritchett, age nine."
Jay,"Geez, I forgot all about that. I didn't know she had that in there."
Phil,"What's that, Francis?"
Jay,Nothing. How much longer on the meat?
Phil,"Aw. I love the part about ""serves one small boy."" That's adorable. Wow. ""175 pounds of tenderness."" She must have loved that. Big woman? Jay?"
Phil,And that's when I saw it.
Phil,Jay... Are... are you crying?
Jay,"No! It's the onions, damn it. Give me these."
Phil,What are you lookin' at?
Jay,Nothing.
Phil,Those really frame your face.
Claire,Oh. Wow. Beautiful.
Gloria,"Ay, thank you."
Claire,"Okay, I don't want you to judge me, but I have to say something. Sometimes, I want to punch my kids."
Gloria,You don't mean that.
Claire,"No, I do. I do. The last time they were horrible the way they were today, they happened to be all lined up. And I couldn't help but think, ""if I hit just one of them, the rest would go down like dominos."""
Gloria,Eee.
Claire,"I know. That would rob me of the pleasure of hitting each one individually, but..."
Gloria,"Oh, my God, you don't talk about your children this way."
Claire,"Oh, come on. You know Manny irritates you."
Gloria,No. Manny is the best thing that ever happened to me. We have a special bond.
Claire,"Yes, bonds. I know. But that's not what I'm talking about now."
Gloria,"Claire, for a long time, it was only the two of us. I cannot say anything bad about that boy."
Claire,"Give a break, Gloria! Anybody who's ever had a kid knows that they can irritate the freaking life out of you at some point. Am I right? Oh. Okay."
Gloria,He's persnickety.
Claire,What?
Gloria,Manny. He's persnickety. It drives me up the wall.
Claire,"Okay, persnickety. Good start."
Gloria,"He follows me around all the time. Sometimes I love it, but sometimes I need my own space."
Claire,This does not make you a bad mother to admit these things.
Gloria,And the poetry. It's not very good. Ah. First time that I say that out loud.
Claire,Okay.
Gloria,It's not very good!
Claire,Wow.
Gloria,"I-I love Manny, but, you know, sometimes I... just be a boy! Go outside. Kick a ball. Steal something."
Claire,Oh.
Gloria,It feels so good!
Manny,Maybe to you.
Gloria,"No, Manny! Ay! I was talking about another Manny that I know long time ago! Diablo! Manny!"
Luke,"You know, more people have died hiking than in the entire civil war?"
Alex,"Ok, what book did you read that in?"
Luke,"Book? Wake up and smell the Internet, grandma."
Haley,You know mom's just gonna want us to apologize.
Luke,"Well, we did kind of ruin her mother's day."
Haley,"No, she ruined her mother's day. She took us to a place she knew we wouldn't like. And then we complain for like a second, and we're the bad guys?"
Alex,That's a good point. You ever get the feeling she does this intentionally?
Luke,Why would she do that?
Haley,So she can make us feel guilty.
Alex,"Exactly. And the next time we're choosing what to do, she gets her way again. And the next time and the next time. And eventually, it's mother's day every day."
Luke,Wow. Mom's really smart.
Haley,"Well, not smarter than me."
Alex,Well...
Haley,"I say we don't apologize this time, let her know we're onto her little game."
Alex,We could change the way this whole family operates.
Haley,"Okay, so nobody says they're sorry. Got it? Keep your mouths shut when she comes back."
Luke,If she comes back.
Phil,"Jay teared up in front of me. He'd never shown me that kind of vulnerability, and it embarrassed him. I'd shamed the proud lion. Only thing to do... hug the proud lion. Oh, I could get bit. I could get scratched. But you know what's inside every lion? A pussycat."
Jay,I need you to get away from me.
Phil,"Yep. Okay, I'm just gonna say this one time so we can move on. It's okay."
Jay,Gotcha.
Phil,"You... you know what ""it"" is? It's you crying."
Jay,Which I didn't.
Phil,You teared up.
Jay,It was the onions.
Phil,"Okay, okay. Maybe I'm... maybe I'm just putting myself in your place, but if I came across something from my childhood, and it reminded me of my mom, I might get a little misty, maybe even want to talk about it."
Jay,Here.
Phil,So proud.
Cameron,"They offered me a bouquet, Mitchell."
Mitchell,Which you accepted.
Cameron,Why can't you ever take my side? They think of me as a woman!
Mitchell,"Cam, no, come on. We're just a new type of family, you know? They don't have the right vocabulary for us yet. They... they need one of us to be the mom."
Cameron,So why does it have to be me? Do I wear a dress?
Mitchell,Well...
Cameron,That's a nightshirt!
Mitchell,It's kind of satiny.
Cameron,What are you saying?
Mitchell,"Come on, you know."
Cameron,"No. No, no, no. I don't know."
Mitchell,"All right, if... if I'm thinking about it, of the two of us, if... if I had to pick, I-I-I might say that you're slightly... mom-er."
Cameron,Can I throw a ball? You don't... you don't think I can throw a ball?
Mitchell,"Cam. No, no, no. That's not what he said."
Cameron,"No, apparently, this gentleman doesn't think I can throw a ball."
Mitchell,"Oh, that's not what he said."
Cameron,"You think I can't throw a ball? Well, let's find out! Ugh."
Mitchell,Oo God. He looks old.
Cameron,"Oh, sorry!"
Mitchell,"Cam, hands."
Cameron,Sorry!
Mitchell,There you go.
Gloria,Please forgive me!
Manny,"I don't think I can. Let's just get in the van. Oh. Sorry for the rhyme. I know how you ""hate my poetry."""
Gloria,"Please, stop my suffering! Say something terrible about me so that we can be even like Steven."
Manny,Why would I say something terrible to someone I love?
Gloria,I curse my tongue!
Claire,"I'm gonna intervene here. Manny, let's talk about what really happened, okay? Your mom said you should go out and throw a ball around. That can't be the first time you've heard that."
Manny,No. But there was some hurtful stuff said about my poetry.
Claire,Which your mom regrets.
Gloria,I do!
Claire,"So? That's what parents are for. Sometimes they criticize because it helps make you stronger. Kids these days get... get trophies just for showing up. What's that gonna lead to? A bunch of 30-year-olds living at home. Manny, your mom loves you very much. But she's a human being. So she let off a little steam. Honestly, it's probably a great thing for your relationship."
Manny,I guess I can...
Gloria,"Stop. He needs to know the real truth. Manny, Claire was feeling bad because she wants to hit her own children, so I tried to make her feel better by inventing terrible things about you."
Manny,You mean you don't have a problem with my poetry?
Gloria,"No, the only problem that I have is that I never have enough of it. You're the perfect kid in every way. Ay, mi amor."
Claire,Wow. That's healthy.
Alex,Good. You're back.
Claire,Uh-huh.
Luke,Are we done?
Claire,Unless the you have something to say to the person who gave you life on her special day.
Haley,Nope.
Alex,I'm good.
Claire,"My baby, Luke?"
Luke,Uh... No.
Mitchell,Hey. Hey. Here.
Cameron,What's this?
Mitchell,"Well, it's a mother's day card. And I know... Stop it! Okay. Cam, that was Gloria's card from Manny but I just wanted you to see was its definition for ""mother"" was on it. It's warm, nurturing, supportive. You know, maybe when the world sees you as a mom..."
Cameron,Not just the world.
Mitchell,"Fine. Fine. Me too. But maybe this is what we're seeing, and I don't know why that's such a bad thing. It certainly doesn't make you less of a man, right?"
Cameron,Maybe you're right.
Mitchell,"Yeah. Come on, let's join the party. And, Cam, put down the scotch. You're not fooling anyone."
Cameron,"It is so burn-y. Oh, my God."
Jay,"Come on, people! Everybody to the table!"
Claire,"It's just hard, you know? Having your mother's day ruined. I never thought it would be you, Lucas."
Alex,Don't even think about it.
Luke,But she's sad.
Haley,Sad she's losing. She just hit you with her best shot. We need to stay strong.
Luke,But I feel...
Haley,Don't feel! Just go splash water on your face and man up! We're your mother now.
Claire,How was your day with my dad?
Phil,"Awkward, actually. He, um... he cried a little."
Claire,My dad?!
Phil,Shh!
Mitchell,Dad what?
Claire,He cried.
Phil,"No, I didn't say he cried."
Cameron,Who cried?
Claire,My dad.
Phil,Stop!
Cameron,Why would you make Jay sob like that?
Phil,I didn't make him sob. He teared up when I found this poem he wrote for his mom as a boy.
Gloria,"What is ""ohh""?"
Mitchell,Phil saw dad cry.
Cameron,Jay misses his mama.
Phil,"Everybody, stop!"
Jay,Is anybody hungry? What?
Gloria,You cried for your mommy?
Jay,"Oh, crap. I did not."
Gloria,"Yes, Phil just told us..."
Phil,"No, that's not true. She's a liar."
Jay,"What's wrong with you? Look, I know you would all be so happy if you thought I had some big emotional moment about my mom, but I didn't."
Manny,So you don't miss your mom?
Jay,"Of course I do. She was a great lady. And she also left me a fantastic recipe for sauce, which now is getting cold. So can we please eat?"
Phil,"Hear, hear!"
Jay,Just grab some wine.
Claire,"Oh, my gosh, smell that. It smells like grandma's house."
Jay,"Hey, you guys remember that?"
Mitchell,"I remember the first time I cut spaghetti. That's what she did! Eh-eh! Yeah, no, you can't cut spaghetti. She taught me to twirl."
Cameron,"Oh, so she's the one."
Jay,"Yeah, she was tough. I remember I had this little league coach. And one time after a game, he was laying into me about something. I don't remember. But mom comes charging out of the stands. She goes right up to the guy... I mean, face to face, nose to nose... and she says to him, ""let me tell you something... nobody, and I mean nobody, yells at my little b... boy."""
Gloria,"Oh, my God! It's happening again!"
Cameron,"It's okay, Jay. Let it out. Let it out."
Jay,You only get one mom.
Haley,"I'm sorry, mom!"
Alex,Me too!
Phil,"A bottle of red, a bottle of... what?!"
Luke,"Oh, yeah, and I'm the weak one."
Manny,All right. Mitchell?
Mitchell,"Oh, I'm good."
Claire,Ohh. Phil!
Alex,Oh. Dad!
Claire,"Come on, honey!"
Phil,I'm sorry.
Haley,"Ew, get off of me!"
Phil,I'm sorry!
Mitchell,"Oh, I think she's calling you."
Cameron,Don't even try. I have that pottery class in the morning.
Gloria,"Jay, let's go to bed."
Jay,Be right up. Son of a bitch.
Mitchell,"Oh, good. You're up. It is such a beautiful day. Let's go have brunch somewhere outside where I can wear my new sunglasses, huh? Ew, gross! What happened to you?"
Cameron,I don't feel good. I'm hot. Now I'm cold.
Mitchell,"Oh, no."
Cameron,And we have that concert tonight.
Mitchell,"I know, but, honey, that's the furthest thing from my mind, okay?"
Mitchell,"Why me?! We had amazing seats for Lady Gaga, and he gets sick. I'd been looking forward to that concert for months. It's the one gay cliché I allow myself."
Claire,"Okay that's it! No more fighting! No more fighting! for the rest of your lives, you are not allowed to yell at each other."
Alex,But you're allowed to yell at us?
Claire,"Yes, Alex, I am, because I feed you and I clothe you and I pay the mortgage."
Phil,Pretty sure old dad deserves a shout-out right about now.
Claire,Phil!
Phil,Sorry. Should've taken the temperature of the room first. What's up?
Claire,"Well, I'm dealing with a lot of high dr..."
Haley,"Luke and Manny barged into our room while we were changing, the little pervs!"
Manny,"Can I just say, in Europe this would be no big deal."
Luke,"Yeah. You can see me in my underwear whenever you want. Here, I'll make it even."
Claire,"No, hey, Luke, Luke, Luke!"
Alex,Mom!
Claire,"Luke, keep your pants on, okay?! And, girls, stop getting so hysterical over everything! Come on! Now, grow up a little! I need things to start changing around here, or I will change things, okay? There will be no more TV and no Internet and no whatever else I can think of. May I have a word with you, Phil?"
Phil,I'd rather not.
Claire,What was that?
Phil,Nothing.
Claire,"Phil, you sold me out behind my back."
Phil,"No! It's just that sometimes you can get a little intense, and I feel like I need to swoop in to let the kids know they're still loved."
Claire,I could kick you.
Phil,"Honey, these are just the parts that we're playing. Am I wrong, or has it been working? I feel like it's been working."
Claire,I'm tired of being the bad cop. You need to discipline them sometime and let me swoop in with all the love.
Phil,Shouldn't we just stick with the stuff we're good at?
Claire,"Oh, my God! This bathroom is disgusting! The girls told me they would clean it days ago. I can't yell at them about it one more time, Phil. You handle it."
Phil,"I would, but I promised Luke and Manny I'd take them go- karting for their good report cards."
Claire,What was good about Luke's report card?
Phil,He didn't lose it.
Claire,"Let me take them. Yes, let me take them. You stay here. Hound the girls about cleaning up this mess, and I will take Luke to do something fun."
Phil,But... I want to go go-karting.
Claire,"Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. This is happening. Boys! Hey, guys, guess who's taking you go-karting today. Me."
Luke,Why? Are we in trouble?
Claire,No! You're not in trouble. Today's just all about having fun! And you know what? Go-karting's just the beginning.
Manny,What else are we doing?
Claire,Whatever you want.
Luke,I want to bring dad.
Claire,"Well, tough. You can't. He's doing something else."
Haley,Goodbye. We will be back in a few hours.
Claire,"Oh, whoa! Where you guys going?"
Haley,"I am taking Alex to the movies, and then I'm going to the mall."
Claire,"How fun! That sounds like fun, doesn't it, Phil?"
Phil,"I'm not much of a shopper, but it would depend on..."
Claire,clean bathroom.
Phil,"Oh. Uh... Girls... How about you clean your bathroom before you go, huh? It'd really help your mom out."
Claire,"Oh, no. It's not about what mom wants. You mom is cool, very cool with whatever. It's about what dad wants."
Phil,Dad wants to go go-karting.
Phil,I would really like it if you would clean your bathroom.
Alex,But my movie!
Haley,Why do we have to do it now?
Phil,"Because Claire says so. Because I say so. And because I'm your dad. And I'm older than you, and I call the shots around here. Right?"
Claire,"Yes, you do."
Alex,This is so unfair!
Claire,"Come on, guys, let's go have some fun!"
Luke,Ow! You're hurting me.
Claire,"Oh, you're fine!"
Phil,"Have fun, guys."
Claire,Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Phil,So... how does this usually start?
Jay,"How you doing, sport?"
Jay,"I didn't know who that was. I never do. At least once a month, I find a total stranger sitting in my kitchen. Gloria collects every kind of stray looking for work, money, you name it. She's got a big heart. It's the one thing I'd like to change about her."
Jay,"Hey, a dog. That's new."
Gloria,"Oh, Jay, there you are. Come. I want to introduce you to Guillermo."
Jay,"Just met him. Really hit it off. Honey, keep it under a hundred bucks, you don't even have to tell me. I'm going golfing."
Gloria,"No, señor! He's a very nice man that works at the grocery store and needs a little bit of business advice."
Jay,"Oh, why didn't you say so? I thought he was just some nut who lived behind the dry cleaner's."
Gloria,"Oh, that's the guy we bought corrective shoes for last month. Jay, he knows how successful you are, and all he wants is an hour of your t... half-hour. 10 minutes. I promise him!"
Jay,"Honey, I love you, but why do you drag me into these things? You've got to learn to say no to people."
Gloria,Fine. Ask me if you can go golfing now.
Jay,Other people.
Gloria,"All I want is, when I go to bed at night, to be laying next to a man that is generous and giving. And that man doesn't necessarily need to be you."
Jay,"Okay, let's do this."
Gloria,Okay. Guillermo!
Mitchell,Do you want me to move the waste basket closer to you?
Cameron,"Oh, no. It's fine where it is."
Mitchell,Really? 'Cause the bed kind of looks like a rose parade float.
Cameron,Thank you for taking care of me.
Mitchell,"Well, what else would I be doing?"
Mitchell,"Um, seeing Lady Gaga, that's what."
Mitchell,"So, uh, Cam, you know, I hate to bring this up, but what are we gonna do about that concert?"
Cameron,What do you mean?
Mitchell,"Well, you know, we were both looking forward to going. You were looking forward to going. I was really looking forward to going. And I just... I-I hate to see those tickets go to waste."
Cameron,"I know, I know."
Mitchell,"But what are our options? We could both go to the concert. That's not gonna happen. Uh, well, we could sell the tickets online. Oh. But there's that Craigslist Killer. Oh, what to do? What to do? What to do? What to do? What to do? Other options, other options."
Cameron,"Mitchell, are you hinting that you want to go to that concert without me?"
Mitchell,No! No! Not in a million years! But that's very sweet of you to offer.
Cameron,I didn't offer.
Mitchell,"Oh, really? 'Cause that just seems like something that you would say.. ""You go, I'll be fine. You spent all the money on the tickets, and I'm just gonna lie in bed anyways."" That's classic Cam."
Cameron,I'm just so weak.
Mitchell,"Okay, good. You know what? It's settled. We're just gonna put this whole ""you insisting I go to the concert without you"" thing behind us."
Cameron,You know what?
Mitchell,What?
Cameron,Can I get one of my little pudding cups?
Mitchell,"Yes, you can. Yes. You eat the pudding, and I'll eat the tickets."
Jay,"Well, you've got confidence. I admire that."
Gloria,"He admires that, Guillermo. You're doing great. Keep going."
Jay,"Well, that's not true."
Jay,"No, you were surprised because it's not true."
Gloria,"Shh! Go on, Guillermo."
Jay,Multibillion dollars.
Jay,"Listen, I hate to interrupt your big pitch, but your dog is chewing my pillow."
Jay,It's not fantastic for my pillow.
Gloria,We're in!
Jay,"Wait, slow down. What are we gonna do about the pillow situation?"
Jay,Wait a minute. You give her a treat for doing something bad?
Gloria,Brilliant! We're going to be rich!
Jay,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is the difference between a bad-doggie treat and the good-doggie treat?"
Jay,But she seems like she likes it.
Jay,"Actually, she's peeing on the ground floor."
Gloria,"Quick, quick, give he a bad-doggie treat!"
Claire,Hello?
Mitchell,"Hey, it's me. Is this a bad time?"
Claire,"No, I'm just in the car."
Mitchell,"Okay, I'm having a moral dilemma. We have tickets for Lady Gaga tonight, but Cam's sick."
Claire,I'll take them.
Mitchell,"Wait, you don't even like concerts."
Claire,"Yes, I do. I'm fun now."
Manny,"Claire, they said we have to be at least 13 to ride the fast ones."
Claire,They're 13. It's fine.
Luke,"This is very confusing. At movie theaters, she says I'm 11."
Mitchell,Can we get back to me?
Claire,What?
Mitchell,Does it make me a horrible person that I kind of want to go without him?
Claire,"Well, how sick is he?"
Mitchell,"I don't know. He's sick. You know, they're not gonna make a lifetime movie about him."
Claire,"Well, what's he like when you're sick?"
Mitchell,"Cam, I think I can walk to the kitchen."
Mitchell,He's okay.
Claire,You should go. You know what I learned today? You can't wait around for somebody to give you something you want. Sometimes you just have to take it.
Mitchell,"Oh, I'm gonna feel so guilty, though."
Claire,"You'll resent him if you stay. So, how about this... you stay home and take care of him... soup, foot rubs, you blow his nose."
Mitchell,Ew.
Claire,"He's so lucky to have you. And then tonight, right before the concert, you say, ""Cam, I love you, but I really want to go."" He'll say fine. You drop Lily off at our house, and it's great."
Claire,I'm putting you on speaker.
Mitchell,What are you doing?
Claire,Making my kids love me!
Claire,"You're going down, Delgado! Like this!"
Luke,"Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
Phil,Hey!
Alex,We're finished cleaning the bathroom.
Haley,We're leaving.
Phil,"See? That didn't take too long. Thank you, girls. Now, go and have a good time, all right?"
Alex,Bye.
Phil,"See? You don't need all the conflict. Note to Claire... if you want intense family drama, rent ""Spy Kids."" They save their parents' lives. You think they would've done that if they got yelled at all the time?"
Phil,Sweet and sour chicken! Girls! Get back h... Got to fix that step. Girls!
Alex,Did he just yell? Drive!
Haley,I'm trying!
Phil,You girls get back here right now!
Alex,Pretend you don't hear him.
Phil,I know you can hear me!
Alex,"Oh, my God, he's heading straight for the car!"
Haley,"Oh, my God! Aah!"
Phil,Stop this car!
Alex,"We're sorry, dad!"
Haley,We couldn't hear you!
Phil,"No more lies! You poked the bear, girls! You poked him!"
Gloria,"In handbags! No, vacation! I know! A home gym!"
Jay,"All right, Guillermo, your ambition is infectious. Clearly my wife needs to be inoculated. But I'm gonna be blunt."
Gloria,"Ay, no, no, you're not going to..."
Jay,"Yes, I am. Now, you wanted my honest business advice, right?"
Jay,Here it is. Your idea is not good.
Gloria,"No, what Jay means is that when..."
Jay,"No, what I mean is it stinks. Now, that's nothing against you. You've got charm, you've got ambition, and that's great. What you need is a better idea."
Jay,Any idea would be a better idea.
Gloria,"Ay, you made him cry."
Jay,"He's not crying. You're not crying, are you?"
Jay,Five? Five years?
Gloria,"Ay, Guillermo, I'm sorry. Why don't you stay for lunch? And... and we can all brainstorm your next idea."
Gloria,Why were you so tough with him? He's very sensitive.
Jay,Did you think that was a good idea?
Gloria,"Of course not! But I'm nice, and I put on the sugar jacket."
Jay,"Sugar coating is not gonna help him. He needed to hear what I said to him, even if it hurt a little bit. He's gonna thank me one day."
Gloria,Ay! Guillermo! Now I have to apologize.
Jay,Accepted.
Gloria,Not to you!
Claire,"What are you gonna get, Luke?"
Luke,I want a cheeseburger.
Claire,Yeah!
Luke,And I can't decide between French fries or onion rings.
Claire,"Get them both! How about you, Manny?"
Manny,"Um, do you have a skinless grilled chicken breast?"
Claire,"What, are you going to the ball, Cinderella? Live a little."
Manny,"I know Claire was trying to be fun, but that crossed the line."
Claire,Anything else? Who wants a milkshake? Milkshake? Milkshake? Three milkshakes.
Luke,"I didn't really want a milkshake. But after what she said to Manny, I didn't want to risk it."
Luke,"Mom, I don't feel good."
Claire,Did you finish your milkshake?
Luke,I think that was the problem.
Claire,Look who's a doctor now.
Manny,Maybe it was the pie.
Claire,"Oh, he's fine. Hey. Hey, who likes roller coasters?"
Luke,I need a bag.
Claire,"No. No, you're not gonna be sick, Luke. We're having fun."
Luke,"Okay. No, I really need a bag."
Claire,Take the lid off the cup.
Alex,I'm starving.
Haley,Me too. Say something.
Alex,"Um, dad? We haven't had lunch yet."
Phil,Neither have half the kids in Africa. Stop yapping and get back to work.
Alex,Why is he taping our laptops shut?
Haley,Because he's out of his mind.
Phil,"I'm not out of my mind! You took advantage, and you lost your computer privileges."
Haley,"Oh, come on, dad. We said we're sorry. Plus I can't get the stupid drain unclogged, anyway."
Phil,Stick that hanger down there.
Haley,"Ew, no!"
Phil,"Well, it's either that or we cut off all your hair, 'cause that's what caused the problem... thoughts? Good, because after you finish this room, you're gonna clean my bathroom, too, and you know how gross I can be."
Alex,Dad!
Haley,"Ew ! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!"
Alex,Ew! Gross!
Phil,All right. Settle down. It's hair.
Haley,"Oh, my God. I'm not cut out for this."
Mitchell,I spent all day nursing Cam.
Cameron,"Ohh. Hey, could you do the right one now?"
Mitchell,You mean the one we started with?
Cameron,Sure.
Mitchell,"I made soup. I made tea. Finally, it was the moment of truth."
Mitchell,"Cam, you know, I was thinking that... Cam, you can say no, but I was thinking about maybe going to that concert. Thank you. You're the best. I love you."
Jay,"Hey, you're back. What happened with your friend?"
Gloria,He's fine. You were right. He did appreciate your honesty.
Jay,How about that?
Gloria,He's gonna make big changes to his life.
Jay,Good.
Gloria,"He's going back to school. That means he has to go back to live with his sister, so that means that he had to get rid of the dog. But he's so much more realistic now."
Jay,See that?
Gloria,Mm.
Jay,"And there's a lesson in there for you, too, 'cause sometimes things go better when you just say no. No, no, no. What did you do?"
Gloria,Ay! He was going to take her to the pound.
Jay,But that's his business.
Gloria,"Ay, but look at her little face!"
Jay,No. You don't even want a dog.
Gloria,I know. I have a problem.
Jay,"Oh, crap, that's Manny. If he sees the dog, it's all over."
Gloria,I go lock the door.
Jay,"Oh, and that's the solution? Manny sleeps in the backyard till the dog dies of old age?"
Manny,"Hey, guys. I'm home. Boy, I think Claire's working through some stuff, because... Oh, my gosh! You got me a dog because of my perfect report card?"
Jay,Gloria?
Gloria,"Sorry, papi, no."
Jay,"The dog lives somewhere else, which is where she's going right now. Text me the address."
Gloria,Okay.
Manny,Can I at least take a moment with her to tell her goodbye?
Jay,Tell her goodbye? You just met her.
Gloria,I'm so sorry.
Claire,"Luke, honey, come back. I said I was sorry."
Luke,I'm 12. I need limits!
Phil,What happened?
Claire,"Oh, I made them drive too fast and eat like vikings, and then Luke threw up all over the car. I got to go clean that up."
Phil,"No, you don't. Girls! Grab your buckets and meet me by the car!"
Claire,They don't have to do that.
Phil,They do if I say so. I'm sorry. I swear I just told you to grab your buckets!
Alex,We haven't eaten all day.
Haley,We're hungry.
Phil,"Well, you won't be in a minute."
Claire,"Honey, you haven't fed them all day?"
Phil,"They're monsters, Claire... Deceitful, manipulative monsters... and they need to be broken."
Haley,He's crazy!
Luke,You know what?! Mom's the crazy one! She ran over my hand.
Claire,"We were having fun! Girls, go to the kitchen. Get something to eat. Phil, honey, this isn't working. Listen to me. You are not a good bad cop, and I am a very bad good cop. We need things to go back to the way they were."
Phil,Yeah. Yeah. I feel really shaky.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,I don't like being you.
Claire,Nobody does.
Cameron,Going somewhere?
Mitchell,Cam! You're up.
Cameron,"Didn't count on that, did you? Are you dropping Lily off at your sister's, or is she taking my ticket?"
Mitchell,"Okay, first of all, how are you standing? You drank enough of that cough syrup to put down a grizzly."
Cameron,"I'll tell you what's grisly. That is your behavior. Well, it's just a good thing I'm finding out now, instead of when I'm old and sick and really need you. Better start saving for some sort of home-healthcare plan, 'cause I'd hate for my broken hip and subsequent pneumonia to interfere with your evening plans."
Mitchell,"Okay, Cam, no, you're right. You're right. I have no defense. I am terrible. And the thing is, I knew I was terrible, and I was going anyway. I think maybe I tried to justify it by saying we're two different people. And you're more of a caregiver, and I have... other strengths. And that's what makes us such a good couple, you know? But... No, no. It's a cop-out. And I've been very selfish, and I need to do better, and I will. I swear on Lily's...diaper bag."
Jay,"Ah, wow. Ah, no place to go but up, huh? Don't look at me like that. We all got problems. This ain't gonna work, sweetie. That look ain't gonna work on me. Come on. Come on. Let's go."
Gloria,"I know it's old-fashioned, but I like a strong man, a man that can say no when I can't."
Jay,Not a word.
Manny,"Ay, yes!"
Gloria,"But instead, I have Jay."
Jay,I'm strong. But look at this face.
Gloria,"Maybe we are the way we are because of the people we're with. Or maybe we just pick the people we need. However it works, when you find each other, you should never let go. Do you two need some time alone?"
Cameron,Oh. Well... I must've dozed off.
Mitchell,"Yeah, you were out for quite a while."
Cameron,What have you been up to?
Mitchell,"I've just been sitting here, watching you,"
Cameron,Well I'm gonna go to bed.
Mitchell,Okay.
Cameron,Thanks for staying home with me.
Mitchell,"Well, you know, in sickness and in health, right?"
Cameron,"You're still blinking, sweetie."
Mitchell,"Oh, no. Oh, gosh. Well, this is... this is funny. I'm gonna tell you the funny thing about why this is, um... this is on."
Luke,Where are my mom and dad?
Phil,"And in this corner, finishing first in her class, delivering the commencement address, weighing in at... What do you weigh, honey?"
Alex,Dad!
Phil,"A healthy amount for a girl her age. Are you getting all this, buddy?"
Luke,Pure gold.
Phil,"She's the main brain, the cerebellum of the ball, Alex Dunphy!!"
Alex,"Oh, keep rolling, the news will want this footage when I eventually snap."
Haley,I thought Sanjay Patel was first in the class.
Alex,He was until he missed a few weeks and the robot he was building attacked him.
Phil,"It's happening, people. Our hubris will be our undoing."
Claire,"Sweetie, what do you say you and I go and get our nails done, huh?"
Alex,It's okay. I want to work on my speech.
Phil,"Been there. I remember the speech that won me treasurer of my high-school Spanish club. ""Mi nombre es Felipe. Yo voy a la escuela..."""
Claire,Felipe.
Phil,It was kind of a grande deal I was up against an actual Puerto Rican.
Claire,"Honey, are you sure? Because I think they can do school colors."
Alex,"I'm good, mom."
Claire,Okay.
Phil,"Family milestones always throw Claire for a loop. She holds it in, and then the next day, she has a total meltdown, and I have to pick up the pieces. Problem is, tomorrow, I'm supposed to go to Vegas with my buds, so... I need her to melt down today. Otherwise, what happens in Vegas won't happen to me because I won't be there."
Phil,"Emotional day, huh?"
Claire,Happy day.
Phil,Happy and sad.
Phil,"""Guys, I can't go to Vegas because my wife's freaking out!"" Trust me, that is not a phone call you want to make to a bunch of ex-college male cheerleaders. They will mock you with a hurtful, rhythmic taunt."
Gloria,Hello?
Jay,"Gloria, it's me."
Gloria,"Ay! How was the doctor? Can you pick up some bread on the way home, please?"
Jay,I'm home. My damn gate remote won't work. Could you press...
Manny,Hello?
Jay,...9?
Gloria,"Manny, it's okay."
Manny,What's okay? What's wrong? Where are you calling from?
Gloria,I'm not calling from. Jay is calling.
Manny,What's wrong with Jay?
Jay,My clicker won't work.
Manny,"Oh, my God, your heart's not working?! How could you tell us this over the phone?!"
Jay,My heart is fine. Would somebody please press 9 and let me in?
Gloria,Okay. Got it.
Jay,It won't work if you're both on the line.
Manny,Okay.
Gloria,Okay.
Jay,Every damn time!
Mitchell,"Okay, Lily, time to get dressed. Okay."
Cameron,I can't believe Alex is gonna be in High School. I feel so old!
Mitchell,"Oh, well, you feel old. I was there when she was born... in the delivery room. If I wasn't gay before, I..."
Cameron,"Oh, please, you wouldn't have lasted two minutes on a farm. I've witnessed all kinds of birthing... never batted an eye. I've seen cattle, I've seen hogs, I've seen goats... I've even seen a three-legged... Ohh!"
Mitchell,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
Cameron,"I'm sorry. Really, Mitchell? I could have just died."
Alex,"Principal Kaizler, faculty, parents, fellow graduates, it's..."
Claire,"Hey, superstar. Oh, you're working on your speech."
Alex,Yep.
Claire,"Well, do you need any help? Because sometimes it's great to bounce ideas off someone whose opinion you value."
Alex,I'm good.
Claire,"Okay. That's cool. Could your hair. We could do it like we saw in that magazine. Oh, what's that actress... What's her name?... with the... you know, with the teeth?"
Alex,"Mom, mom, please. I'm... I'm trying to concentrate. Okay?"
Claire,"Okay. Well, you be ready to go in a half-hour, because we are going to carpool with your grandpa."
Alex,Haley's driving me. I want to get there early.
Claire,That's a great idea. Great. I will see you there... Superstar.
Phil,"Hey, mama bear. You okay?"
Claire,"Not with ""mama bear"" I'm not."
Phil,Don't cry.
Claire,I'm not crying.
Phil,Shh! Don't be brave. I'm here for you.
Phil,"Until 2 P.M. tomorrow, when my flight leaves for Vegas."
Gloria,Where were you? Did you bring the bread?
Jay,I was stuck outside that gate for 10 minutes before it opened.
Gloria,So no bread?
Jay,We got to get that thing fixed.
Gloria,Ay! What happened to your eye?
Jay,What are you talking about?
Gloria,It's droopy.
Jay,"What do you mean, ""droopy""?"
Manny,"Aah. I don't like the look of that, Jay. Here, let me check something. Jay ; Put that thing away. I saw my dermatologist. He was checking for moles or something. He probably got some numbing cream on it. It's fine! Nothing to worry about."
Jay,"I got botox. Stupid doctor talked me into it, and now it's drifting. I haven't felt this dumb since I shelled out 30 bucks for that bracelet that's supposed to give me better balance."
Jay,Try to push my arm down.
Claire,Okay.
Jay,Go ahead. You can't do it. You can't do it.
Claire,Okay. All right. I can't...
Phil,"Honey, I'm home. Hey, uh, why is your dad's car here? Mwah!"
Alex,"""It's ironic that I stand up he representing my classmates when, for the past three years, most of them have treated me like I'm invisible. It's my own fault. I was obsessed with good grades instead of looks, popularity, and skinny jeans."""
Haley,What?! Is that your speech?!
Alex,Get out of here!
Haley,You cannot say that!
Alex,"Yes, I can! And you want to know why? 'Cause it's the truth."
Haley,"No one wants to hear the truth. It's very simple, Alex. In order to give a good speech, all you have to do is take a song and say it, like... ""Don't stop believin'"" or ""get this party started."""
Alex,That means nothing.
Haley,"Who cares? Nobody wants to think. It's a graduation, a celebration of being done with thinking."
Alex,People want to be challenged. They're gonna respect me for it.
Haley,No one's ever gonna talk to you again.
Alex,So what? Mahatma Gandhi went on a hunger strike for what he believed in.
Haley,That's 'cause no one would eat with him in the cafeteria!
Mitchell,Hey!
Claire,Hey.
Jay,Come on over. Have some lemonade and cookies.
Gloria,"Jay, that's not looking very good."
Jay,It's fine. Quick! Who's the president?
Phil,Obama!
Manny,"Phil, please. I'm trying to rule out a stroke."
Jay,It's not a stroke. Why does everybody always assume I'm having a stroke?
Claire,Age.
Manny,Diet.
Gloria,You forgot to bring my bread.
Mitchell,I'm sorry we're late.
Claire,"That's okay. We got to leave in about 5 minutes, though. Luke, stop pushing that ball around! You're gonna fall in."
Cameron,"Oh, yes, and then your Uncle Mitchell will laugh at your expense! I'm just saying it's a character flaw."
Mitchell,"Okay, okay, quick poll here. This morning, Cam, fully dressed..."
Jay,Thank God it's one of those stories.
Mitchell,"...while in the middle of a very serious thought, fell into a ducky pool."
Phil,"Oh, my goodness. Are you all right?"
Cameron,"Yes, I am. Thank you. That is a normal reaction... Love and concern."
Mitchell,"Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. The pool popped."
Gloria,Ay! Poor thing!
Claire,There is nothing worse than a tailbone injury.
Mitchell,"Seriously? No, no, no, no. You're so full of it. You know this is funny. Picture this falling into a tiny pool."
Cameron,"He'll be here all week, folks! Literally, because you're not coming home with me."
Claire,"There she is. There's my little Stella. That's my girl. Hi, sweetie. You're so cute, I just wan eat your face!"
Phil,"You remember when you used to hold Alex like that, and you wanted to eat her face?"
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,Now she's off to High School.
Claire,Mm.
Phil,"Time marches on, huh?"
Claire,Yep.
Phil,You know what's really sad?
Claire,What?
Phil,"The end of ""Titanic."""
Manny,"Hey, Luke. Do you realize, in two years, you and I will be graduating?"
Luke,Not now. I think I'm moving the ball with my mind.
Manny,"Well, I'll be graduating."
Mitchell,"You guys, stop congratulating yourselves for being so compassionate. If you had been there, you would have laughed just as hard as I did."
Gloria,He's coming. Stop talking. He's been embarrassed enough today.
Cameron,Wow. Now it makes sense. It's a Pritchett thing. Cruelty's genetic. Suddenly it's all very clear.
Mitchell,Be careful. You might run into it.
Jay,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Cam. I'm sorry."
Claire,"Oh, my God, dad, your face!"
Jay,"What? Oh, that's nothing, nothing. It's boring. I went to the dermatologist. It's a boring story. I'm fine."
Mitchell,"No, no, no, we got to get you to a hospital."
Jay,I'm fine.
Gloria,"Yes, I'm taking you. Come."
Jay,"Gloria, no, wait."
Gloria,¡Vamos!
Jay,"Wait right here! Gloria? Gloria?! Gloria? Gloria. Gloria, hold on. The reason my face looks like this is because I had... botox."
Gloria,Like the ladies use for their wrinkles?
Jay,"Well, actually, nearly 10% of their sales are men, but that's not important. I had a bad reaction. Hit a nerve or something. It's gonna go away soon. What? What's that supposed to mean?"
Gloria,Nothing.
Jay,Would you stop? This is very embarrassing for me.
Gloria,For both of us. He's fine. It was a false alarm.
Claire,"What do you mean, a false alarm? His face looks like a candle."
Jay,You heard her. I'm okay.
Manny,She's not a doctor.
Jay,Neither are you.
Manny,Technically.
Mitchell,"Okay, look, I don't know what's going on here, but there is no way that this is normal. You look like a botox job gone horribly wrong. No... my... God. You didn't."
Claire,Of course he didn't. Did you?
Jay,No.
Claire,You did!
Cameron,What were you thinking? You're a veteran.
Jay,Enough! This conversation is ended. Let's go.
Phil,"Do you think he got his butt done, too? It looks fantastic."
Haley,"Alex, wait. I'm sorry. If you want to give your speech, go ahead. I was never valedictorian. What do I know?"
Alex,Thank you! I am doing this for a reason. It's not just like I'm...
Haley,"Aha! Sorry, Alex, but you will thank me one day!"
Alex,Please. You really think I don't have duplicates?
Haley,"If you do this, you'll be a social piranha."
Alex,"Yes, I'll be an Amazonian carnivorous fish."
Haley,Carniv... what?!
Claire,"Dad, open the gate."
Jay,"Oh, geez, not now!"
Claire,What? What's happening?
Jay,It's stuck again.
Claire,"What do you mean, it's stuck? Can't you get it open?"
Jay,"What do you think ""stuck"" means, Claire?"
Claire,"We have to do something, dad. Can't you... can't you push it open or something?"
Jay,I don't know!
Claire,"We are trapped in your driveway, and you don't know? As a gate owner, dad, you have a certain responsibility. See, my daughter is gonna get up on that stage and give a speech and graduate from Middle School, and if I am not there, dad, I am going to freak out! I am going to freak out!"
Jay,Maybe push it.
Claire,I am going to freak out!
Mitchell,Why are you smiling?
Phil,I'm not... I'm not smiling.
Phil,Chun-chunk. Hysterical wife. Hysterical wife. Hysterical wife. Jackpot.
Claire,"Come on. All right. Okay, we have tried this way. I say we ram the gate. Kids, get out of the way."
Cameron,"Hold on! I think I can fix this! I just need a paper clip, some olive oil, and a ribbon."
Jay,"What's the plan, ""MacGyver""? Actually, the paper clip is to connect these two circuits, and the olive oil is to lubricate the mechanism. And the hair ribbon is for Lily. Her hair's been driving me crazy all day."
Mitchell,Why don't we just call some cabs?
Claire,"Because, Mitchell, this is not Times Square, and they'll take forever."
Phil,"Well, then we'll just climb over the fence and start running."
Claire,"No, we won't, because it's 5 miles away, Phil! And I'm in big shoes, so, no."
Gloria,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! I save the day. Let's take this crazy bicycle, we throw it over the gate, then we take Phil and we take Claire, and then we throw them over the gate, too."
Mitchell,"All right, what the hell is that?"
Gloria,"Jay bought it. He thought we were gonna use it all the time, but I keep hitting my boobs with my knees."
Jay,"Champagne problems, right? Honey, they're not gonna ride the bike."
Gloria,"Yeah, but I still think that we should throw it over the gate."
Claire,"Okay, you know what? Thank you. Thank you. Nobody else has come up with an idea."
Luke,I think I've got a good idea.
Phil,"We don't have time to build a rocket, buddy."
Luke,Never mind.
Claire,"Okay. So... Phil and I will go over first, and then you guys will throw over the bike?"
Phil,"Okay, step up. I'll boost you."
Claire,Couldn't we get a ladder?
Phil,"Please, I'm cheer's squad, I boosted girls bigger than you to the top of a human pyramid. Now, arms at your side. Straight like a pencil. One, two... We are bulldogs!"
Claire,Aah! Ow!
Phil,"She's fine. Okay. Jay, now you do me. Just grab a handful. Don't be shy. I'm not giving you as much to work with. I used to have a lot more there. I lost it. They used to call me ""The Grand Can."""
Alex,"""It's ironic that I stand up here representing my classmates when, for the past..."""
Haley,I read the rest of your speech.
Alex,Congratulations.
Haley,Do you hate me?
Alex,What?!
Haley,You talk about how all the popular kids are shallow and lame.
Alex,I didn't mean you.
Haley,"You think you have everyone figured out, but everybody has their stuff."
Alex,"What ""stuff"" do you have? Too many boys chasing after you? Too many parties?"
Haley,"You really want to know what ""stuff"" I have?"
Alex,Yeah.
Haley,"I'm flunking out of biology. And now I have to go to summer school. My friends... all they can ever talk about nowadays is going off to college, and I don't even know if I can get into college. Is that enough ""stuff"" for you?"
Alex,Whatever.
Haley,"You know what? Fine. Give your stupid speech. Be an outcast. But you're only doing it to yourself because you're smart and pretty and sort of funny in a way that I don't really get but other people seem to enjoy, so, you can either start fresh next year or be the freak who flipped off her class."
Alex,You really think I'm pretty?
Haley,Shut up!
Claire,"Phil, go straight!"
Phil,This way's faster!
Claire,"No, straight!"
Phil,Stop leaning! Do you want to drive?!
Claire,I do.
Phil,"Tough, I called it!"
Claire,What was that?!
Phil,"Oh, crap. The chain broke!"
Claire,Just keep pedaling. It doesn't matter.
Phil,It matters a little!
Mitchell,"Cam, please be careful."
Cameron,"Why? If I get electrocuted, my hat might blow right off. That'd be funny as hell, right?"
Mitchell,No. No.
Manny,"Hey, Jay! I know you're feeling self-conscious, so I dug out something I thought might help."
Jay,Put that thing away.
Manny,"I knew you'd say that, but hear me out. This was designed to make a hideously disfigured man look supercool. It's perfect for you. Oh, yikes. Okay. I'll go upstairs and see if I have a lefty."
Jay,Don't look at me like that.
Gloria,I have to say that I am a little disappointed in you doing this thing.
Jay,Not me. I feel real good about it.
Gloria,Now many times do I have to tell you that you don't have to look young for me?
Jay,I didn't do it for you.
Gloria,What is her name?!
Jay,"Stop. Most of the time, I walk around, and in my head, I'm 40. Then I look in the mirror, I say, ""who's that old man? And what's he doing in my bathroom?"""
Gloria,"Well, it's my bathroom, too. And I like when the old guy is there. This is the face that I fell in love with. Not this face... This one."
Cameron,Ooh! Ooh! The gate's opening! The gate's opening!
Mitchell,How did you do that?
Cameron,I didn't do anything.
Luke,I did it. I opened it with my mind.
Jay,"Come on, guys! Let's go, guys!"
Gloria,¡Vamos! Manny! Get Manny.
Jay,Everyone in the car. Let's go!
Phil,Yep. That's what I thought. Chain's broken. What do you think?
Claire,I think we gotta go.
Phil,"Sweetie, we... we can't make it on foot."
Claire,We have to try.
Phil,Honey. Honey! It's okay.
Claire,"It's not okay, Phil! It's not okay. We're losing her."
Phil,Alex?
Claire,Yes.
Phil,You're not losing her.
Claire,"We are. She's going to High School. This is just when I lost Haley. This is when Haley went from being my sweet little angel to being a moody, texting, snotty little princess who hates me."
Phil,Haley doesn't hate you. And we're not losing her.
Claire,"Do you remember when you used to come home from work and Haley would meet you at the door in her little ""Aladdin"" pajamas? And, you know, she'd stick her arms up in the air and say, ""daddy, daddy, take me on a magic carpet ride."" Remember that? When was the last time Haley was that excited to see you?"
Phil,I don't remember. It's been so long.
Claire,"We're losing another one. And that's what kids do... they leave. They leave, and they... and they don't come back."
Phil,"Well, ours will come back, right?"
Claire,"What if they don't, and... and, pretty soon, it's just the two of us?"
Phil,I don't want to go to Vegas anymore.
Claire,I know.
Phil,I just want to hug them and embarrass them in front of their friends.
Claire,"I know. And Alex... my God. If we miss this speech... Honey, she's a middle child... she will never forgive us."
Phil,We're not missing that speech! Hello! Hello!
Claire,"What's the plan, Phil?"
Phil,Mi nombre es Felipe. Yo voy... a la escuela.
Phil,"Yes, please!"
Claire,Felipe?
Phil,"Okay. ¡Vámonos, muchachos!"
Mitchell,I'm sorry I laughed.
Cameron,"I don't need an apology, but I will say your behavior today has been very eye-opening. No offense, Jay."
Jay,None taken. You look like an iceberg.
Claire,"Okay. Señor, this is it... right hear, yeah. Okay. Let's go."
Phil,"¡Muchas gracias, muchachos!"
Luke,Where's my mom and dad?
Alex,Thank you.
Gloria,Mm... there they are!
Claire,"Come on, Phil!"
Alex,Principal Kaizler...
Claire,"Hold on, Phil!"
Alex,...Faculty...
Phil,"Oh, sweet cream! I'm sliding!"
Claire,"Oh, my God, Phil!"
Alex,...school-board administrators...
Phil,I got you. Get up. Get up. I got you.
Alex,"...Fellow graduates, parents, and everyone who helped us through these challenging formative years…"
Mitchell,Cam! You have lost all credibility.
Cameron,This is completely different.
Mitchell,How?
Cameron,It's the juxtaposition of absurdist comedy against the backdrop of a formal setting... Not a big-boned man falling into a pool.
Mitchell,Really? Shh! This is about Alex.
Alex,"…It's ironic that I stand up here representing my classmates when...they're so... awesome... They should be up here themselves. But I'm up here, and... I'm sayin'... stuff, 'cause everybody's got their... stuff, whether you're popular or a drama geek..."
Cameron,Oh.
Alex,...or a cheerleader... or even a nerd like me. We all have our insecurities.
Cameron,"Yes, we do."
Alex,We're all just trying to figure out who we are. I guess what I'm trying to say is...don't stop... believin'...Get this party started.
Haley,Whoo!!
Cameron,That's so cute.
Alex,Seriously?
Jay,There she is!
Phil,Here's our girl!
Cameron,Your speech moved me.
Gloria,I loved how you play with the song titles. Fantastic.
Haley,My idea.
Jay,"You did good, kid."
Alex,"Thanks, grandpa. Aah!"
Gloria,Don't ask. He'll be fine.
Mitchell,Yes. We are so proud of you. Come here.
Luke,Hello. I opened a gate with my mind.
Claire,What do you say we all go get something to eat?
Jay,Let's do it.
Alex,"A-actually, I was kind of just invited to a party. Would it be okay if I go?"
Claire,Yeah. Of course.
Alex,Yay!
Jay,"See you, kid."
Phil,Have fun.
Alex,"Thanks for coming, you guys!"
Cameron,Bye! Congratulations!
Haley,"Hmm. I'm kind of hungry, mom."
Phil,"Oh, my God. She's back. My baby."
Haley,What?
Claire,My baby.
Haley,"Oh, my God."
Phil,My little baby.
Haley,What are you doing?
Jay,Let's go. Let's go eat.
Haley,I'm not hungry anymore.
Phil,"Oh, you're not gonna regret this."
Cameron,I could use some shrimp.
Haley,I'm not hu... I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry anymore.
Claire,Sure you are. Sure you are.
Haley,"I'm not... no, I'm not."
Luke,"Hey, mom... Listen to this card dad got for grandpa Jay."
Phil,"""Hip-hip-hip-hooray! Save the extra hip. You'll need it someday."""
Luke,'Cause he's old!
Claire,Mm. You're not giving him that.
Phil,Even if he drinks his other gift first?
Claire,"Nope. Ladies... Do you remember exactly one year ago today when you did not have a gift for your grandfather and it killed him just a little, so I suggested you start interviewing all the members of the family for a video tribute?"
Haley,"Well, check it and burn... We totally did that."
Alex,Hmm. Almost. We just need to finish the editing. And you should talk. You haven't even started on your gift yet.
Claire,That's because I changed mine. I thought of a better idea yesterday.
Phil,I think I came up with a better idea.
Claire,"Okay. My dad has a picture of me and Mitchell when we were kids, standing in our old backyard. We're gonna re-create the picture."
Phil,"I did the same thing last year for my parents for Christmas, and it went over like gangbusters."
Claire,Mm. Funny.
Phil,Do you remember?
Claire,"Oh, I do. I do."
Phil,Ohh.
Claire,"Come on, girls, TV off. It's your grandfather's birthday. We got to start taking this seriously."
Mitchell,Permission to come aboard.
Jay,"My best birthday memory... I'm a teenager, and for some reason, I drag this boat out on the lake. And for hours, I'm just lying there, fishing, alone with my thoughts. Fantastic. That's all I want this year."
Gloria,So that's really going to be your day? You're going fishing?
Jay,"With time out for a gourmet lunch. Sausage of the month club really nailed it in may. But, honey, no offense. They almost lost me last month with that chorizo."
Gloria,"Why ""no offense""? It's a sausage. It's not on our flag. Lily, what are you doing here?"
Cameron,Surprise!
Cameron,We were just on our way to get Jay's cake and thought we'd pop by.
Cameron,Lily was driving me crazy all morning. I had to get rid of her.
Cameron,She refuses to get dressed.
Mitchell,"Well, did you try bribing her?"
Cameron,"Oh, no. Of... of course I did! I cannot go back in there, Mitchell."
Mitchell,Why did we ever decide to have a kid?!
Cameron,I don't know. I don't know!
Mitchell,"Oh, come on!"
Cameron,"She loves you so much. Just this morning, she was looking at a picture of you, and I swear she was trying to say your name."
Gloria,"Really? Ay, I would love to spend more time with her, but I have to go to the Mall to get Jay's gift for his birthday."
Cameron,"Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. Gloria's busy. No, don't cry. We should go."
Gloria,"Oh, maybe I can take her wi..."
Cameron,"Okay. Bag's packed. Have fun. Bye, sweetie."
Manny,"Hey, Cam."
Cameron,"Oh, hey, Manny."
Manny,"Mom, is Jay still here?"
Gloria,"No, he just left."
Manny,Shoot.
Cameron,"Why? What's up, pal?"
Manny,"I'm going over to a friend's house where I may have to use this thing. I only used it once, and that was to take a torte out of the oven."
Cameron,"Okay, well, first, let's loosen this thing up. So what's her name?"
Manny,How'd you know?
Cameron,"Well, you're pretending to be something you're not. Boys do that for girls... or really dreamy boys."
Manny,"Her name's Tara. We have great chats online. She's really smart and funny, but she's on the softball team."
Cameron,"Well, nobody's perfect. Hey, you know what? Why don't we go outside and toss the ball around?"
Manny,Okay.
Cameron,And you know what? I wouldn't worry too much. She's gonna like you even if sports aren't your thing.
Manny,Aren't my thing? I have a tennis racket upstairs I only use as a bubble-bath frother.
Cameron,Wow.
Manny,How do you put this on?
Phil,Aha! Hilarious.
Phil,"Glen Whipple, my college rival... Captain of the cheer squad. Winner of every robot battle. every second I spent with the guy just made me feel worse about myself. The only thing I could compete with him in was close-up magic."
Phil,"Well, it's great to see you."
Phil,What? When?
Phil,"Oh. Well, great to see you. Yeah. By the way, don't leave without this quarter from behind your... come on, Phil!"
Gloria,Phil?
Phil,Hey!
Gloria,Hey.
Phil,What are you two doing here?
Gloria,Shopping for tonight.
Phil,"Oh, well, I'll walk with you."
Gloria,Where were you heading?
Phil,The card store.
Phil,"I didn't think anything of it... Until other people started making the same mistake. It reminded me of a college job I had parking cars. One day, I had to park an Aston Martin. I'll never forget the looks I got driving that baby down the block. I wasn't gonna dent this one."
Phil,"Hey, uh, w-what would you think about swinging by the shoe store?"
Gloria,"Okay, let's go."
Mitchell,I still can't believe all the looks we got driving over here.
Claire,And yet you wore the hat the whole time.
Mitchell,Don't you think we should park on the next block over? 'Cause this is all permit parking.
Claire,"No, we used to live here. It's fine."
Mitchell,"Yeah, still. I..."
Claire,I don't think anybody's home. Here. Hang on to this.
Mitchell,"What... wait, where are you going?"
Claire,"The backyard. We'll take this picture really quickly, and then we'll just get out of here."
Mitchell,"No, let's just... let's just wait for them to come home. Okay, that... that's trespassing!"
Claire,"No, it's not. We used to live here."
Mitchell,I don't think that does what you think it does.
Claire,"Of course you would baby out, because this is just like pool-hopping all over again."
Mitchell,I just... I don't see what was fun about that. It made going in grandma's pool less special.
Claire,Why don't you try being a little less special?
Mitchell,Is it far?
Jay,Hello.
Jay,"Oh, I must have her phone. She probably grabbed mine again. Listen, this is her husband. You have my number right there, probably. Give that a call."
Jay,"Yeah, it's me again. I'll be right there. Yeah, I did blame her for no reason. You have a little bit of an attitude. You know that? You know who did your job in my day? A hose."
Claire,"Okay, a little to your left, a little to your left. Yes, okay. Right there. That's it. That's it. Perfect. Okay. And now I must run."
Mitchell,"Here, okay. Fast."
Claire,"Here we go. It's weird being back here, isn't it?"
Mitchell,"I know. Everything looks exactly the same. Well, you know, except for the fence."
Claire,"Yeah, what's with that? Who are they trying to keep out, anyway?"
Mitchell,"I know. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God."
Claire,"Oh, wow. Oh, my God. No, it's okay. He might be friendly. He looks nice. He looks nice. Hi. No! Oh, God! He's... quickly, quickly. Not nice. So not nice. Hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Now what do we do?"
Mitchell,"Well, you could try telling him we used to live here."
Mitchell,They're never coming home. We need to call someone.
Claire,Use your phone. Mine's down there getting rabies on it.
Mitchell,"No, I left mine in your car."
Claire,What?
Mitchell,I didn't want to ruin the line of my pants.
Claire,"Oh, God. Oh, look. Somebody's coming."
Mitchell,"No. Okay, that is what happens when you park without a permit. Stop! That's ours! We're up here! Stop! He ignored me."
Claire,He didn't stop for the screaming sailor in a tree? Give me your shoe.
Mitchell,"What, you think that wolf down there is gonna be afraid of a shoe?"
Claire,"No. No, I don't."
Mitchell,Wh... what are you doing with dad's wine?
Claire,Getting comfortable. We could be here for a really long time.
Mitchell,Whoa! Where'd you learn how to do that?
Claire,Where'd you get a sailor suit on short notice?
Mitchell,Fair enough.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Mitchell,Ew. It's Merlot.
Cameron,"Hello. Manny! Hey, how'd it go with Tara?"
Manny,It's still going on. The catch part went fine... mostly. I took a running dive into the dirt.
Cameron,"Oh, well, did you at least catch the ball?"
Manny,I was trying to throw the ball! I'm in her bathroom looking for band-aids. I'm trying to get up the nerve to tell her how I feel.
Cameron,"Well, just be honest."
Manny,"She intimidates me. Every time I open my mouth, I say something stupid. I called her bedroom ""fantazing."" That's not even a word!"
Manny,Yeah! I'm just water-washing my hands! Help me! Tell me what to say.
Cameron,"Okay, how about this... You are the prettiest, smartest, funniest girl in the sixth grade. I know you're only 11, but I can't stop thinking about you. I've loved talking to you online. I think we should become boyfriend and girlfriend. No, it's not what you think. I'm talking to a little boy."
Jay,"Hello. She's not with me, Cam. I got her phone. Why are you crying? How do you get kicked out of a bakery? Well, that'll do it."
Cameron,"I sorry to ask you to get your own birthday cake, but I can't get ahold of any... anyone else."
Jay,Can't do it. I'm on my way to the lake... Finally. Just get something at the grocery store.
Cameron,"I am not getting you a grocery-store cake. Gloria asked me to handle this. She's gonna yell at me, Jay. She can be mean in Spanish!"
Jay,"Okay, fine. Let's wrap this up, princess."
Cameron,Okay. Love you. Bye.
Luke,What are you guys doing?
Haley,Just editing our birthday tribute to grandpa.
Alex,"You know, some of the interviews I did didn't turn out so well."
Haley,That's okay. We'll just use the best stuff from what we all got.
Alex,"Okay, Haley, talk about grandpa."
Haley,Eww. I can't talk about grandpa dressed like this.
Gloria,I love my... that stupid dog next door! Jay! Jay! Jay!!
Mitchell,"...Three, four, five."
Alex,"Hey, Uncle Mitch, what do you think"
Mitchell,"One, Two..."
Alex,What are you doing?
Mitchell,"N-nothing. You didn't see this, and w-we don't tell Cam. Capisce?"
Alex,It'll only take one minute.
Phil,We don't have a minute.
Alex,Who's Clive Bixby?
Phil,A friend of your mom's. Not now!
Alex,"Hey, Uncle Cam, can you to talk about..."
Cameron,Jay. I know. No time. I got a little girl's birthday party to save. Skedaddlo... go!
Claire,"Oh, not now, honey. Your father's out back. Why don't you call him? Phil! Dad! Your kids need you!"
Luke,Grandpa is really cool. He once let me drink some of his beer.
Phil,For the love of...
Luke,Root beer!
Alex,I could've sworn we had more!
Luke,"Well, let me work my magic. It's all about creative editing. Just give me two hours and another hour. Somebody get me some chocolate milk with extra salt."
Claire,Do you remember the time you quit cub scouts and dad got mad at you so you ran away up here?
Mitchell,Right. And you brought me my dinner up here...
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Mitchell,...And my comic books.
Claire,Yep. I think mom and dad would have been a lot more scared if you hadn't been running into the house to use the bathroom.
Mitchell,"I can't go outside. Great, now I'm thinking about it."
Claire,"Mitchell... It's ironic. We always wanted a dog in this backyard, and we could never have one."
Mitchell,Y... Manny got one.
Claire,Mm. Manny gets everything.
Mitchell,"Yeah. Hey, you think Manny's gonna get a third of..."
Claire,A third of what?
Mitchell,You know.
Claire,"Oh. Uh...I guess. Sure. I mean, that seems fair, right?"
Mitchell,"Does it? Claire, does it? 'Cause I just feel like..."
Claire,Okay? You know what? I think we've probably had enough of this.
Mitchell,"Okay, wait. Do you think if we could get the dog to chase this doll, then we could run down and grab the phone really quick?"
Claire,We could do that!
Mitchell,Yeah.
Claire,"We just are gonna have to throw it really, really far."
Mitchell,Right. So... That way.
Phil,"Gloria, um, I'd still love to swing by that shoe store."
Gloria,"If you're in a hurry, go by yourself."
Phil,No. I'll wait. Whipple! Whipple!
Gloria,Okay! Mm! What do you think?
Phil,"Oh, it's perfect. Uh, l-let's see the other side. Whipple!"
Gloria,Bless you.
Phil,Thank you.
Gloria,"It's a little too tight, no? What do you think of the tush?"
Phil,"Oh, I think it's great. Why don't you keep it right there for a second. Let's make sure."
Gloria,"Yeah, but it's a little see-through. Maybe if I put this underneath, then it won't, like, show."
Phil,"No, no, no, no, no. It looks good that way."
Gloria,I go try something else better.
Phil,"No, wait! Wait!"
Phil,"Hilarious, whipple. I'm actually here with someone."
Phil,She was here a second ago.
Phil,There was traffic.
Gloria,I think I found something that is going to make my husband very happy. What do you think?
Phil,"Oh, very happy, Gloria. Very happy."
Gloria,"Okay, but don't go far away because I might need help with the zipper, okay?"
Phil,Sounds good... with the zipper.
Phil,"It would appear so. Great to see you, Glen."
Phil,Surprised... Or mystified? Damn it. It went down your shirt. You can... keep it. I'll see ya.
Phil,You remember Claire?
Phil,You were jealous of me?
Phil,I can.
Phil,Yeah.
Gloria,"Phil, I need you!"
Phil,"What now?! Oh, uh, I'm sorry. I'll be there in a second. No! How?!"
Jay,"What the hell were you thinking? I'll answer that for you. You weren't thinking. You think that's funny, Popeye?"
Mitchell,No.
Claire,Popeye.
Jay,"I should be fishing, but I'm hauling my ass across town trying to save you two from a little dog."
Mitchell,At least we got to have a dog for a few minutes.
Jay,"There we go. You could show a little gratitude, you know. These pants are new. Climbing over that fence, I might have wrecked 'em. That's mature."
Mitchell,I'm sorry. We're sorry.
Claire,I'm so... we're sorry.
Mitchell,"I'm sorry you said ""rectum."""
Claire,"I'm sorry, dad. Um, we're so glad that you came and got us. - Thank you. It was very smart the way that you distracted the dog."
Jay,"12 times a year, I get sausages. That's it. What the hell am I gonna to do till June?"
Mitchell,Hey.
Gloria,Let's see it. It's beautiful.
Mitchell,We just need some candles.
Gloria,"I-I must have in one of the drawers. Okay. Froot loop necklace... Baby Jesus... ...key... ay, I was looking for these keys. Baby Jesus... BB Gun... More baby Jesus... Ay, another baby... Jesus, Stella! Don't do that!"
Jay,Gloria?
Gloria,"No, Jay! Don't come in here! You cannot see the cake! It's the bad luck!"
Jay,I already saw the cake. I bought it while I was busy not fishing.
Gloria,No. Go out to the bar. Go!
Jay,You never used to talk to me like that before we got that damn dog.
Cameron,"Hey, Manny. I almost called you. How'd it go with Tara?"
Manny,"Okay, I guess. I used every line you gave me, and she totally ate it up."
Cameron,"Oh. Well, then, why just okay?"
Manny,She wants to go on a date now... to the batting cage.
Cameron,Ohh. Not so good with a bat?
Manny,"I am, as long as I'm using it to roll out dough."
Cameron,"I'll bet you just need a little practice. You know, when I was your age, I couldn't hit a balloon with a bat. Then my father took me out to the field, and a couple hours later, I was knocking the hide off that ball. It's one of the best days we ever had together."
Manny,Really?
Cameron,"Yeah. I just bet you need some time in a batting cage. What are you doing this weekend? That'd be fun, huh?"
Manny,That's a great idea! I'll ask Jay. He loves stuff like this.
Cameron,Oh. That'll be great for you guys.
Manny,"Yeah. And thanks for your help today, Cam."
Cameron,You got it.
Luke,I don't think grandpa's having the best time. He keeps going and getting more drinks.
Haley,"Well, not every time. One time he went in to check on the women's basketball score."
Jay,"The Sparks are up by 8, if anyone cares."
Claire,"Okay, dad, we all owe you an apology. We were so worried about giving you a great night that we ruined your day, and I'm really sorry we didn't let you go fishing."
Mitchell,"Sorry, dad."
Cameron,"Sorry, Jay."
Jay,"You know what? I'm acting like a jerk. What am I, 12?"
Luke,Hey.
Jay,"So I didn't get to go fishing. What, am I gonna pout about it? I still have my family, and you guys made such a big fuss. I love you all."
Claire,Aww.
Jay,So let's go get some cake and presents.
Claire,"Yes! Cake and presents! Come on, everybody!"
Phil,Honey?
Claire,Yeah?
Phil,"Have I told you how lucky I am to have you? Gloria, excuse me. 'Cause I am."
Claire,Okay.
Cameron,Hap...
Jay,No singing. What the hell happened to the cake?
Gloria,"Nothing. It's beautiful. Okay, let's open the presents."
Claire,Yes! Presents! Who's first?
Gloria,Mine first. Mine first.
Mitchell,"And as you know, Claire and I. ...We didn't quite finish ours, but we will be getting that to you."
Jay,Fine.
Phil,And our gift is a fuller version of that and a card.
Jay,Wonderful.
Cameron,"And, of course, the cake is, uh, mine."
Jay,Fantastic. And here we have a phone... In the shape of a mouth.
Gloria,"Ah, you're welcome! Very sexy!"
Jay,"Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me. Let me work this out. I mentioned a few times that I was thinking of taking up the saxophone, and you give me this. I got it! Is this a sexy phone?!"
Gloria,Happy Birthday!!
Claire,Wow.
Jay,"All right, what else we got?"
Claire,"Oh, uh... N-nothing. Hmm. Maybe not a perfect showing on behalf of the adults in the family, but don't forget the kids still have their big gift."
Alex,And it took us a year to make.
Luke,It's in the DVD player. You've got to come watch it.
Mitchell,Okay.
Gloria,"I'm so excited! Let's go, Jay! And bring your sexy phone."
Jay,"Oh, don't forget that."
Mitchell,"Okay, and... and, uh, we all participated, so this is kind of from all of us."
Luke,Yeah. Hit the lights!
Claire,Dad!
Cameron,Jay!
Gloria,Jay!!
Luke,Grandpa...
Mitchell,We...
Phil,Love...
Haley,Eww!
Mitchell,Capisce?
Luke,"Well, who wants to see it again?"
Alex,That's it? That's all you used? I wasn't even in it!
Haley,That totally sucked.
Jay,"You know what? Great party. Thank you all for coming. And I hope you forgive me. I'm gonna go upstairs, curl up with a ludlum, and call it a day. Hello. Manny? Where are you? What are you doing out there? What the hell?"
Manny,"I dragged it back here this afternoon. I know it's not the lake, but maybe we could pop open a few drinks and hang out on the water?"
Jay,"Now, the old Jay would have said, ""I wanted to be on a lake with a fishing rod and sunshine, not bobbing around at night in a swimming pool."" I miss the old Jay."
Manny,"This is the life, huh?"
Jay,It ain't half bad.
Gloria,"Ay, I want to get in the boat!"
Jay,Captain?
Manny,All right.
Alex,Me too! I want to get in!
Cameron,"So, how was your day with Claire?"
Mitchell,"You know, it was actually... It was really great. I don't... I don't always think about it, but I-I was really lucky to have her to grow up with. You know, I cannot imagine dealing with my crazy parents alone."
Cameron,Yeah.
Mitchell,Cam?
Cameron,Hmm?
Mitchell,I... I want to have another baby.
Cameron,What would you think about a boy this time?
Jay,"All right, easy !"
Gloria,Ay!
Jay,Easy! Easy!
Gloria,"No, no, no! You're rocking the boat!"
Phil,I got Claire! I got Claire!
Mitchell,"All right, ahoy! So, if we all just, uh..."
Claire,"Okay, everybody... upstairs and, Luke, I want you to get in a hot bath right away."
Luke,I'm still shivering.
Claire,Ohh.
Alex,That's why you don't stand up in a boat.
Luke,I was king of the world.
Haley,"Well, now you're dork of the night."
Phil,Honey... Have I told you how lucky I am?
Claire,You mean since dinner?
Phil,"I can't help it... your beautiful eyes, your silky hair. Promise me you'll never... change."
Claire,"I have to admit, that's kind of hot. Maybe I will go change."
Phil,I still got it. Knock it off!
