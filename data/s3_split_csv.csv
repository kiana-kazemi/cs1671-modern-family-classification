Phil,Reckon we'll be landing soon.
Claire,"Phil, honey, you promised... not till we got there."
Phil,"This year, we're going to a dude ranch with the whole family."
Claire,Mm-hmm. The family.
Haley,What if Dylan buys his own ticket? We'll be sleeping in separate cabins.
Phil,What if Dylan and I share a horse?
Claire,"Mm, I hate landing."
Gloria,"Wow! Oh, my goodness."
Jay,What are you doing?
Gloria,I want my ears to pop.
Manny,Try putting a little Rouge on 'em. Nobody gets me.
Mitchell,"Wow. Isn't this beautiful, little cowgirl?"
Cameron,"You hate her sparkly outfit, don't you?"
Mitchell,"No, I told you, it's fine. I just didn't like you wearing a matching one."
Mitchell,"So we haven't told the family yet, but we've decided to adopt a baby boy."
Cameron,"From America this time. You might say we're ""buying domestic."""
Mitchell,In private... You might say that in private.
Cameron,Our adoption attorney told us it would be a good idea to make a photo book to show prospective moms.
Mitchell,"But he thought that Cam's version was a little too ""artsy,"" so we've decided to take a few rugged shots at the ranch to, you know, balance it out."
Cameron,I don't think it need balancing out.
Mitchell,Really?
Cameron,"It's called ""Production value."""
Mitchell,Horse.
Gloria,"Look, Jay! So beautiful!"
Jay,"Your ears haven't popped yet, huh?"
Gloria,I'm like the horse whisperer. But something is making this one skittish.
Haley,They're amazing.
Claire,Where's a cliff when you need one?
Jay,"Look, kids! A real life cowboy!"
Luke,Oh. Come see. Come see.
Claire,Uh-oh.
Luke,What's he doing?
Claire,"Oh, my."
Manny,"Uh, do we book spa treatments through you or..."
Manny,That wasn't an answer.
Gloria,What?
Jay,That's my wife Gloria.
Jay,"These, uh, these nicknames... are they set in stone?"
Phil,"I heard word of trouble in these parts. Pull! That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?"
Jay,You got a piece of it.
Phil,"I've been practicing like crazy, all my cowboy skills... shootin', ropin'. pancake eatin'. Why? Because sometimes I feel like Jay doesn't respect me as a man."
Phil,"It's just that when you say, ""Phil is my son-in-law,"" it sounds like you're saying, ""Phyllis, my son-in-law."""
Jay,That's ridiculous.
Phil,"Okay, who's your son-in-law?"
Jay,Phyllis.
Phil,"I'm not asking for a hug. I just want to get that look of newfound respect, like... Or... Or... mm. Yeah."
Phil,"Check it out. Two birds, one leg. Pull it! Not bad, eh, Old-timer?"
Gloria,What?
Mitchell,"Oh, me. Me."
Cameron,"Oh, this is good. This is good. Tres macho. No smile. Don't smile. Good."
Mitchell,"Wait. Do I say ""pull""? Sorry. Sorry."
Jay,"Mitchell, why don't you go find Manny at the spa? Wouldn't that be more fun?"
Mitchell,Yeah.
Mitchell,"I realized that if I was gonna raise a boy, I needed to butch up my life. You know, I wanted to be able to teach my son all the things that my Dad taught Claire."
Luke,"Hey, Hollywood."
Manny,I don't love that.
Luke,Wanna see something?
Manny,"Oh, my gosh. Is that a firecracker?"
Luke,Shh! Now I just need to find the perfect thing to blow up.
Manny,Is that thing even legal?
Luke,"Not here. It's from Germany. If they had this during the war, right now we'd all be knee-deep in strudel."
Alex,Watch it!
Alex,Trying to.
Alex,I'm not surprised.
Alex,"I'd rather see you get hit by one, but..."
Gloria,Jay! Is this like the lobster?! Do I get to pick one for dinner? Because this one looks very tender.
Jay,"Hey, something's wrong with my horse. She's veering left. When this happened to my Uncle, it was a stroke."
Jay,"She's deaf, but I can hear ya."
Cameron,Why are you riding that way?
Mitchell,I'm afraid that cow over there might bite me.
Cameron,"Oh, yes, he's gonna come up and bite you because your leg looks so desirable with those... are those canvas?"
Claire,"Okay, Phil, ease that one back over towards me."
Phil,Got it.
Claire,Ease him back this way.
Phil,"Hey! Piece of cake, huh, Jay? Huh?"
Phil,Which one's Bossy?
Phil,Hilarious.
Haley,"Go, Mom! Whoo!"
Claire,"Oh, I wish I had a rock."
Phil,Hey. It wouldn't kill you to be nice to Dylan.
Claire,"It might. But, honey, I don't know why you always stick up for him. Haley can do so much better."
Phil,Because I know what it's like to fall for a girl whose dad thinks I'm not good enough.
Claire,"All right, you're right. I can make more of an effort."
Phil,That's the woman I love.
Phil,No. Sorry. I was just talking to Bossy.
Claire,Phil!
Phil,I'm sorry.
Gloria,"Jay, look! I got this one! I got this one!"
Jay,"She's veering left again. When we get back, I'm gonna see if she can track a pencil with her eyes."
Alex,"Okay, Lily, I'm going to push you one more time. Now don't kick me, okay? Aah! Oh! Lily! I said don't kick me. Okay?"
Alex,You are an idiot.
Alex,Why are you following me?
Alex,"I really, really don't appreciate you calling me ""gorgeous."" I just want to enjoy time with my family, so if you don't mind... mm!"
Alex,"No, the boy kissed me. Okay, Lily? The boy kissed me."
Claire,"Okay. Hey, Dylan."
Claire,I was wondering if we could have a little chat.
Claire,"No, no. It's the... the opposite of that."
Claire,"No, I, um, I want you to know how glad I am that you're here."
Claire,"Oh. Dylan, no. I'm sorry. I-I like you. I-I like you a lot. I just... It's complicated because Haley's my daughter."
Claire,"Oh, my God. Okay, we... there's... no, no. I merely meant that I'm sorry if I made you feel unwelcome."
Claire,So awkward.
Claire,Yes?
Claire,Yeah.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Claire,Okay. Good talk.
Gloria,♪ She'll be running down the mountain. she'll be running down the Mountain when she comes ♪
Jay,The song ended two minutes ago.
Jay,Really? You notice the crickets left? Anyone want more water?
Mitchell,"Oh, Dad, I'll take one."
Jay,Heads up.
Claire,"Oh, my gosh."
Mitchell,Oh. It was... it was dark. I-I couldn't see it. Thank you.
Manny,So did you set off the firecracker yet?
Luke,"When I do, you won't have to ask. First, all the electronics will go out, then comes the heat flash. Afterwards, the living will envy the dead."
Manny,"And yet I'm the one on the ""No-fly"" list."
Cameron,You know what? Maybe next time I'll just catch it and then hand it to you.
Mitchell,"Oh, okay. Yeah, let's do that. You... you do everything, and I'll do nothing."
Cameron,Something on your mind?
Mitchell,This isn't the right place to talk about it.
Cameron,Okay.
Mitchell,I-I'm s... I'm not sure if we should have another baby.
Cameron,What? Are you serious?
Mitchell,I think that we might be rushing into this.
Cameron,Rushing into... we've been working...
Claire,"No, no."
Claire,"No. No, no, no, no, no. No proposals. Not now. Not gonna happen. She's a child, so..."
Haley,Mom!
Claire,You're still in high school!
Claire,"Not then. Not now. Not ever. Seriously, what are you two gonna live off of? The... the... the royalties from the horsey song? Put it back in your pocket."
Haley,Would you stop it?
Claire,"No, I won't. I won't."
Haley,"Dylan, wait! I hate you!"
Claire,"Oh, come on. Haley, get back here! Phil, anything?"
Phil,"I think you said it all, Claire. You want me to rope her? I can, you know."
Cameron,"Sweetie, here. Here we go. One, two, three. One, two, three. Gone."
Cameron,It's not back there.
Cameron,Yes.
Mitchell,Hey.
Cameron,Where have you been?
Mitchell,I-I slept on the couch in the lodge. I know you didn't want to have a big fight last night.
Cameron,"Well, I'm ready now."
Mitchell,"Cam, I'm sorry. Look, what if I can't do the father-son stuff? The hunting, the... the sports, the Three Stooges? You know what happens in real life when someone gets hit in the head with a ladder? They go to the hospital and they get an MRI. Never see that scene."
Cameron,"I think you're overthinking this. You know, I love sports, I love the Stooges. We've got this covered."
Mitchell,"No. No, you... you got it covered, but I'm just stuck on the sidelines, pretending to understand the rules, and... You know, my dad was a rough- and-tumble guy, and I just... I could never relate to him. And I don't know. I just don't think I could handle disappointing... two generations."
Cameron,I think you're more masculine than you give yourself credit for.
Mitchell,Who puts a birdhouse next to a porch?
Gloria,"Claire, I know that you're worried that Dylan is gonna break Haley's heart, but I see in his eyes that he's gonna stick with her forever. No matter what, he's always going to be with her. On your deathbed..."
Claire,Okay. All right. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna go find her.
Jay,"No. You push too hard, you chase her right into his arms, you'll end up with a boob for a son-in-law. Believe me, you don't want that."
Phil,What's that supposed to mean?
Jay,What?
Haley,"Hey, have you guys seen Dylan?"
Claire,No. No. Why?
Haley,"I'm not talking to you. He said he was going out for a walk last night, and no one's seen him since."
Phil,"Sweetheart, I'm sure he's fine. Maybe after last night, he just went home."
Manny,Doubt it. He left his luggage.
Haley,"We have to do something. If he doesn't eat five times a day, he gets spacey."
Claire,What would that even look like?
Phil,We'll find him. Hank? We got a situation here!
Alex,We need to talk.
Alex,You stole my first kiss.
Alex,"I had it all planned out. It was supposed to be special, someone with a high GPA and a bright future, not a Mario brother."
Alex,"Well, keep it. I don't... I don't want it anymore. What am I doing?"
Haley,Can I go with my Dad instead?
Phil,Buffalo Phil... worth the wait.
Jay,Maybe I should ride up there with her.
Haley,"""Another""?"
Jay,"Phil, help me saddle my horse, will ya?"
Phil,"Well, look who's suddenly needed by his father-in-law. Phyllis. Phil... is."
Luke,"Hey, Uncle Mitch. Whatcha doing?"
Mitchell,"Oh, hey. Just... just thinkin'."
Luke,"You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you're a super fun Uncle. And I'm saying this as a boy."
Mitchell,"Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?"
Luke,"What? That's hilarious. No, I love how you and me can joke like this."
Mitchell,"Okay, Luke, look, I don't know how much Cam told you, but I don't think this is a problem that you can help me with. It's..."
Luke,"Okay, good. I've got my own problem."
Mitchell,What? What's that?
Luke,Can you keep a secret?
Mitchell,"I kept a pretty big one for 22 years, so..."
Luke,"I've got this new firecracker, and I can't decide what to blow up."
Mitchell,"Oh, Luke, that's dangerous."
Luke,I know. That's what's fun about it.
Mitchell,I don't get boys. What is so great about destroying things?
Luke,It turns stuff into flying chunks of stuff.
Mitchell,"Okay, no. No, g-give it to me. Come on, give it to me."
Luke,Fine. I take it back. You're not that fun.
Mitchell,"All right, hey, look, um, we'll do it together, all right?"
Luke,You just made the best decision of your life.
Mitchell,Okay. Come on.
Jay,Damn it! Buttercup! What the hell's wrong with this horse?
Phil,Jay. Wow. I want to talk to you about that son-in-law crack you made at breakfast.
Jay,"Oh, I didn't mean anything by that."
Phil,"I think you did. I get that I wasn't your first choice to marry Claire, but it's been 18 years, and there hasn't been a day when I wasn't a loyal husband to your daughter and a great dad to your grandkids. So if we've still got a problem, now it's your problem."
Jay,"Phil, wait up. Let me ask you something, man to man."
Phil,Okay.
Jay,"You notice anything funny about the... Hank character and, uh..."
Phil,"Gloria? Yeah, He's hitting on her. Why?"
Jay,I knew it.
Phil,Where are you going?
Jay,"Destiny Ridge. Buttercup, ha! Buttercup, hiya! Seriously?"
Mitchell,"Okay. Okay, it's clear."
Luke,"After this, we're gonna have some angry birds."
Mitchell,"Yeah. It's gonna be ""Bye bye Birdie."" It's a big musical from the '60s. No. Forget it. What you said. Okay. Okay, go."
Luke,That's it?
Mitchell,"I'm sorry, buddy."
Luke,I brought that thing all the way from... whoa!
Mitchell,Whoa!
Mitchell,"Cam, I did a boy thing! I blew up the birdhouse! You should have seen it. It was so awesome."
Cameron,That's great!
Mitchell,"Yeah. I think I can do this. I mean, maybe not everything and maybe not right away, and not the three stooges..."
Cameron,No.
Mitchell,I do. I want a son. I'm sorry I panicked.
Cameron,"Oh, that's great. Now maybe we can go back to taking pictures for the book."
Mitchell,Yes! Pictures of me blowing up stuff!
Cameron,"Okay, I see we've overcorrected."
Claire,"I know you think I'm the mean mom who wouldn't let you marry your boyfriend, but someday you're gonna realize, I-I did what had to be done."
Haley,"No, you didn't. I was never gonna marry Dylan. I told him no. But it was my proposal to turn down. You know, you keep telling me to act like an adult, but then you don't even give me a chance."
Claire,"Oh. You sort of got me there. But, sweetheart, I don't expect you to understand this. I certainly didn't when I was your age. I look at you as my baby, and I always will. It's... it's just what moms do."
Haley,I'm not a baby anymore! Okay? And I am never gonna see Dylan again! Dylan! Dylan!
Haley,Where are you?!
Haley,You're okay!
Haley,"Uh, what... what do you mean, she hired you?"
Haley,S-so you're staying?
Haley,What about us?
Claire,I'm just... I'm so glad you're okay. I really am. I am.
Claire,Right.
Gloria,Dylan! Dylan!
Gloria,Dylan!
Gloria,Dylan! He ain't down there.
Gloria,Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband?
Gloria,Really?
Jay,Hey! I think you better move away from that woman.
Phil,Only we touch our women when they don't want us to.
Gloria,He doesn't need you to make him a hero. He's a hero every day.
Jay,"Why don't you do us all a favor? Get back on your horse, ride down to the lodge and tell 'em.... Can you keep him still? I'm trying to make a point."
Phil,I am.
Phil,"Wait. Wait. There's something I wanna say to you. I will only be checking ""somewhat satisfied"" on our comment card."
Jay,Jeez.
Phil,"I mean, he was great with the kids."
Alex,"I looked it up. The distance between our houses is 2,443 miles."
Alex,"God, you're stupid."
Phil,"All in all, it was a great vacation. We may have lost a man... But out there on the range, under that great big sky, we found a part of ourselves we never knew was there, just like the horny cowboy said we would."
Mitchell,No.
Cameron,Fine.
Claire,"Okay, let's see... Oh, could you grab me an extra virgin..."
Phil,I think one's enough for the sacrifice.
Claire,"Olive oil, Phil."
Phil,Come on. That's funny.
Claire,"Oh, it's funnier than your freestyle ""sandwich rap."""
Phil,"Girl, you crazy. I'm mad fun to shop with. ♪ Trapped in between two whole wheat slices. Pastrami and Swiss are my only vices. ♪"
Claire,"Sweetie, my shoe. Come on. Jesus. God."
Phil,Hello.
Phil,"Oh, roadblock. Beep beep! Pardon me."
Phil,Are you okay?
Claire,"Actually, not okay. Not okay."
Phil,"Honey, did you pull from the bottom again?"
Cameron,"So after hors d'oeuvres, we'll bring everyone in here to share the news."
Cameron,We're having the family over tomorrow night to tell them we're planning on adopting a new baby.
Mitchell,"Yes, and we both agreed to... to go a little more low-key with the announcement this time."
Mitchell,"Okay, just to be clear, this is low-key?"
Cameron,"It's a banner and just some light musical accompaniment, Mitchell. I don't have a lower key. Besides, this is a happy occasion. Am I right, Lily? Aren't you excited to get a new baby brother?"
Mitchell,"We are having a slight issue getting Lily on board with the adoption. ""I hate the baby."""
Cameron,"""No new baby."""
Mitchell,"""I wanna make the baby dead."""
Cameron,I thought we weren't gonna share that one.
Mitchell,I-I-I just hope that the problem is she hasn't spent much time with any babies.
Cameron,So we thought it would be a great idea to show her how much fun it'll be to have one around.
Mitchell,"Oh, he is so cute!"
Cameron,"Oh, no, that's not weird. My sister was born with a full set of teeth."
Mitchell,"Yeah, that never happened."
Cameron,Oh. No? Really? You should've seen her crib. It looked like beavers lived there.
Mitchell,"Oh, yes, it is. Hey, honey. Say hi to the baby."
Mitchell,"Oh! Okay, so that's one problem solved."
Cameron,Bye! See you soon! Or never.
Mitchell,"Cam, I'm a little freaked out about what Lily did."
Cameron,"Oh, please. She barely touched him, and he went from zero to big crybaby."
Mitchell,We're talking about bringing another child into this house. How's that gonna work with Lily being so possessive of you?
Cameron,Why am I hearing an accusatory tone?
Mitchell,"Oh, come on. You have to admit that you do coddle her."
Cameron,I will not apologize for loving our daughter.
Mitchell,"I'm not criticizing. I'm not only criticizing, but we did talk about giving Lily a little more independence."
Cameron,"Yeah, which is why we put her in preschool."
Mitchell,"Yes, but you can't bear to leave her there. You always pick her up early."
Cameron,That is ridiculous.
Mitchell,"Okay. Okay. Lily, honey, did daddy pick you up early from preschool today?"
Cameron,Case closed.
Mitchell,Case opened.
Cameron,That's enough.
Cameron,You are going to your room.
Mitchell,You're both going to her room.
Cameron,"Do we spend a lot of time together? Yes Do we have a special bond? Absolutely. But do I coddle her more than any other loving parent? It's possible. And for Lily's sake, I should probably work on that."
Gloria,"No, you calm down! This is how I talk when somebody accuses my Manny of stealing."
Jay,Who is that?
Gloria,"It's the principal. He's saying that Manny stole some girl's locket. What, do you think that all Colombians are criminals because a Colombian necktie is a symbol of violence all over the world? No, no, I'm not threatening you. Okay. Apology accepted. No, I didn't mean anything about the necktie. I just... I was trying to make a point."
Alex,"Could you ""L"" a little less ""O L""? Don't you see what I'm trying to do here?"
Haley,Die alone?
Claire,"Girls, dinner!"
Alex,"You know, why does Luke get his own room, and I still have to share with you? I can't take it anymore."
Haley,"Me either, even if it is just for one more year... When I leave for college."
Alex,Is it one more year or when you leave for college? Because those happen to be two different things.
Phil,"So I hear this little voice coming from the cans and it's like... ""Help! I fell in the peaches!"""
Luke,That's Mom! Hilarious!
Phil,"So hilarious. I'm like, ""Claire?"""
Claire,You might wanna tell them that it was you who pushed me into the peaches in the first place.
Phil,This again? I wasn't even near you.
Claire,"Yes, you were! You knocked me with the cart. It was completely your fault."
Phil,"Well, let's just agree to disagree."
Claire,No. I-I disagree to disagree.
Phil,Then you agree.
Claire,"No. No, I don't, because I'm right."
Phil,"Okay, Claire. You're right."
Haley,As usual.
Claire,"No, I am right."
Haley,Like always.
Claire,"Stop it. When I am wrong, I admit it."
Luke,Which is never.
Claire,Fine. Fine.
Manny,Aah!
Jay,"You're a little jumpy tonight, Manny. Anything wrong?"
Manny,"No. Well, I'm just gonna..."
Jay,"Have a seat, kid. You know, maybe it's me, but I thought you were kinda squirrelly tonight, you know, before when your mom was on the phone with the principal. Almost like you wanted to say something... But you just couldn't. Anything you wanna say now, Manny?"
Manny,No. I have nothing to say.
Jay,You sure about that? Think real hard.
Manny,Could I get a glass of water?
Jay,"That girl's locket... you took it, didn't you?"
Manny,Um...
Jay,Didn't you?
Manny,"Yes. Yes, I took it. I didn't mean to."
Jay,"I don't wanna hear any excuses. You're gonna tell your mom, and you're gonna set this right. Do you understand? All right, get out of here. Just one more thing. You're not, um... You're not wearing that locket, are you?"
Manny,No. Of course not. It's a girl's. Why would I want to wear it?
Jay,No reason.
Manny,"Mom, hurry up! I don't want to be late for school."
Jay,"You didn't tell her, did you?"
Gloria,"What's the hurry this morning? Okay, what's with the looks? It's like a silent movie in here."
Manny,"Okay. I was walking behind this girl Alicia, who's moving away, and I was working up the courage to get her new address so I can write her. I express myself a lot better on paper than..."
Jay,"Tick-tock, kid."
Manny,"Well, she dropped her locket, and I picked it up, but she kept walking, and I..."
Gloria,"You stole the locket. After I told the principal that you could have never done something like that, and I threaten him with the Colombian necktie! Manny, why?"
Jay,Don't worry. It wasn't 'cause he wanted to wear it.
Manny,"I thought I could keep it as something to remember her by. But then you were yelling at Mr. Vickers, and I-I was just too scared to tell you."
Gloria,Go to the car.
Manny,I'm really sorry.
Gloria,Go. Why would he do something like that? It's bad enough that he's the boy with the pan flute and the puffy shirts and... and the poems. Now he's the jewelry thief.
Jay,Might be an upgrade.
Gloria,"Ay, Jay, this is not funny. Those things stick to you. My cousin Rosa Marina, when she was 14, she stole something, and after that, everybody thinks of her as the girl who steals cars."
Jay,She stole a car?
Gloria,"Cars. But after she got that label, what else could she do?"
Jay,"Listen, you can't control what kids think, but you can make sure he learns from this. You take him to the principal's office, he owns up to it, he never does it again."
Gloria,Okay. Okay. But what was he thinking? This is not even real gold.
Alex,"No way, Haley! It was my idea! I'm taking this room!"
Haley,"Over my dead body! This is going to be my room, and there's nothing you can do about it!"
Alex,Seriously?
Luke,What are you guys fighting about?
Haley,"Okay, so we both think that this would make a totally awesome bedroom."
Alex,But only one of us can have it. Don't you think it should be me?
Haley,"Oh, so not. It should be me. Right, Luke?"
Luke,Why do you guys wanna move into the attic?
Haley,"Oh, you mean ""the penthouse""?"
Alex,With all the privacy of being on its very own floor?
Luke,It is kinda cool.
Luke,"I'm not an idiot. I knew what they were up to, but I've been wanting to move for a while. There's a line of ants going to a trick-or-treat bag in my closet, and I don't want to still be there when they get tired of candy."
Mitchell,"Good morning, princess. Good morning, Lily."
Cameron,"Very adorable, Mitchell, but I'm having kind of a rough morning,"
Cameron,"I'm sorry, Lily, those days are over. Now here's your lunch. Go get your bag. We will be leaving shortly."
Mitchell,"Cam, you don't have to ice her out completely."
Cameron,Do you think I'm enjoying this? But I need her to detach from me before the new thing comes or who knows what she'll do to it.
Mitchell,"Why are you saying ""thing"" instead of ""baby""?"
Mitchell,"Oh. Um, look, I-I-I know this is hard, but I really appreciate what you're doing. And believe me, I take no pleasure in seeing you suffer like this."
Mitchell,"I take a little pleasure. No, but there--there are very few parenting issues where I come out on top. You know, I'm distant. I work too much. My French braiding is ""sloppy."" Finally, you know, something that isn't my fault."
Cameron,Okay. Could you please just go put her in her car seat while I compose myself?
Mitchell,"All right, you know what, Cam? Why don't I just take Lily to preschool on my way to work?"
Cameron,I think that would be best. Let me just whip up a smoothie for you before you go.
Cameron,You certainly do.
Manny,"What do you think the principal's going to do to me? I am a first-time offender. Oh, great. Now I'm tardy. Strike two."
Gloria,"Manny, think of this in a positive way, like it is your ""ha ha"" moment."
Manny,What does that mean?
Gloria,"That means that one day, you're gonna laugh about it."
Manny,"Ah, I should've just given that stupid necklace back to Alicia when she was standing right next to her locker. This is the worst day of my life, till tomorrow..."
Gloria,Oh.
Manny,"And every day after that. Come on, Mom. Let's get this over with."
Gloria,Wait.
Manny,What?
Gloria,Which one did you say that it was her locker? This one?
Manny,Mm-hmm. The one that smells like rose oil. Mom?
Gloria,"Keep the lookout. Now promise me that you will never, ever do anything dishonest again."
Manny,I promise.
Gloria,"Okay, because that's not the way I raised you. Don't tell Jay anything, okay?"
Manny,Mnh-mnh.
Mitchell,"All right, Lily."
Mitchell,"Have fun, sweetheart. Bye."
Mitchell,"Oh, thanks. Well, you should've seen her yesterday. Yeah, she pushed a baby off of Cam's lap."
Mitchell,"I know. I know. She is so possessive of him, but, you know, Cam's really working on trying not to coddle her so much, So..."
Mitchell,Really?
Mitchell,"Oh. Oh, miss Elaine."
Mitchell,I have been told that I might have the teensiest issue with sharing. But is that something Lily would even pick up on?
Mitchell,My chicken... My pillow.
Cameron,Ow! Mmm.
Mitchell,Daddy's pen.
Mitchell,"Okay, it's possible. And I suppose for Lily's sake, I-I should work on that... Privately, because right now we really need to get Cam's coddling problem under control."
Claire,What's going on?
Luke,"Moving into the attic. Give me a day or two to get settled, then I'll have you up."
Claire,When did all this happen?
Luke,Depends on who you ask. My plan's been in motion for three weeks.
Claire,"Honey, this is a terrible idea. You're gonna hate it up there."
Alex,"Mom, stay out of this."
Haley,Yeah. We all have our own rooms now. Everybody wins.
Claire,"Well, don't get too comfortable in there, girls. Luke, it's cold, and it's scary up there. You're gonna be back in your own room by tomorrow night."
Phil,"I don't know, Claire. It's got a lot of potential. This is a lot nicer than the attic I lived in when we met."
Claire,"One night, if that. Trust me on this."
Haley,"Oh, yes, because you're always right."
Claire,"Sweetheart, I would love to be wrong. I just don't live with the right people for that."
Phil,"Let it go, kids. She's not gonna budge. Kept me up all night with the..."
Claire,"Phil, you did push me!"
Phil,"Your word against mine. Guess it's one of those things we'll just never know, like what really happened to the ""Titanic."""
Claire,It hit an iceberg.
Phil,Maybe.
Claire,"Mm, there's no maybe."
Phil,"Oh, you're right, Claire."
Haley,Again.
Luke,"Surprise, surprise."
Claire,"Okay, I-I will see you over at Uncle Mitchell's. I'm gonna skip this meeting of the ""Pile on Claire club""."
Phil,"Guess I pushed her into that pile, too."
Jay,I spend half my life waiting on you. How many times do you have to change your outfit?
Manny,"Sorry, Jay. Too many choices is a prison."
Gloria,Just drive before he rethinks the pants.
Manny,What's wrong with my pants?!
Gloria,Go. Go. Go.
Jay,"So, Manny, how'd it go with the principal today?"
Gloria,"It was terrible, but he was brave, and now it's over. Right, Manny?"
Manny,Mm-hmm.
Gloria,Mm. So d...
Jay,What'd they give you? Detention? Suspension?
Gloria,"No, just a warning because it was first offense. So how was work?"
Jay,"Great. Just a warning, huh?"
Manny,Like she said.
Gloria,"So I ask about work, and you change the subject."
Jay,Are you trying to hide something?
Gloria,"No, I just wanna make sure he's okay."
Jay,"You okay? 'Cause, I mean, it looks like you're sweatin' bullets back there, kid."
Gloria,"Stop grilling him. First the principal, now you. This poor boy has been screamed at all day."
Manny,"Well, not to mention..."
Gloria,Quiet! I've got this.
Gloria,Where is Lily?
Cameron,"Um, she's getting dressed."
Claire,All by herself?
Mitchell,Cam is encouraging her to be more independent. Oh. And there she is!
Claire,Ah! Ah!
Mitchell,Doesn't she look beautiful?
Cameron,She looks like she was dipped in glue and dragged through a flea market.
Alex,Hey there!
Mitchell,"Hi, guys. Come on in. How's it going?"
Luke,"Hey, do you guy have any old furniture? I'm moving into the attic."
Mitchell,The attic?
Luke,"Hey, at least it's big. Grandpa said you used to live in the closet."
Cameron,"Oh. Okay. Well, you know what? Yeah, we'll absolutely find you something for sure. Okay?"
Mitchell,"Lily, no! I-I'm sorry, Luke."
Luke,This isn't over.
Cameron,"Oh, my God. Mitchell, she's getting worse. I have turned her into a pushy, little, entitled monster on her way to a rap sheet and a bracelet on her ankle. Oh, she has a bracelet on her ankle."
Mitchell,"Cam. Cam, Cam, This... this might not be entirely your fault."
Cameron,"No, it is."
Mitchell,"I spoke with Lily's teacher, and she thinks that--that she may have a problem with sharing, which she might have gotten from..."
Cameron,You. You don't like to share.
Mitchell,"No, I do it to make a point sometimes. Like, if you want the chicken, then order the chicken."
Cameron,"Wait, when did you talk to Lily's teacher?"
Mitchell,"Uh, today, when I--when I dropped her off at school."
Cameron,And you let me suffer all day?
Mitchell,"All right, look, we... we can't do this with everybody here. Can we please just get through the evening?"
Cameron,"Yes, but we are not making the announcement tonight because that is a joyful thing, and I am not feeling very joyful right now."
Mitchell,"Well, I share your feeling."
Jay,"Just so you know, I'm on to you. You never took Manny to the principal. Okay, play it like that, but I know Manny. He has more of a conscience than you have. He's not gonna be able to live with this."
Gloria,"You'd be surprised what people can live with, Jay."
Claire,"Hi, miss Lily. How's my big girl doing?"
Claire,Can you tell me how old you are now?
Claire,"That's four. This is three. Okay, show me again. How old are you?"
Claire,No! That many is four. This many is three.
Phil,"Don't argue, Lily. You'll never win."
Claire,"Really, Phil? Okay, I-I was gonna wait until we got home for this, but now I think it's something everyone's gonna enjoy. Guys, everybody, come on down to the TV room. I've got something really special to share."
Cameron,"Okay, how's everybody on drinks?"
Gloria,"If this is Alex's graduation again, just leave me the bottle."
Jay,"I'm good, Cam."
Claire,"Okay, everybody. Showtime."
Phil,"Oh, my gosh. It's us at the market. How did you..."
Claire,"Uh-huh. Yeah, it's security camera footage."
Mitchell,I don't understand. What are we watching?
Jay,"It ain't ""The Godfather,"" I can tell you that much."
Claire,"Okay, look, I fell yesterday at the market, and Phil and I have been having a little disagreement as to what happened. Just watch. Okay, right here. I stop to fix my shoe, and then Phil... right there. Okay. He makes way for this very attractive woman, whom he conveniently leaves out of his retelling of the story. Now right here, Phil backs up, pushes his butt into the cart, pushes me into the cans! Do you see that?! It's all his fault, just like I said! I was right! Suck it!"
Phil,When did you get this...
Alex,"Oh, my God. That's why you wanted to come separately."
Haley,You went to all that trouble just to prove you were right?
Claire,"It really wasn't that much trouble. I just went to the store, found your friend Jordan the bag boy, who got me the manager. He gave me the address of the off-site security office. I filled out some paperwork. Sally faxed it to corporate. Three minutes later, I'm buying pack of DVDs and burning a copy. Cake."
Luke,It's like a sickness.
Claire,"What? None of you believed me, so I got proof. You should all be sucking it right now."
Gloria,"Hey, please stop with the ""sucking it,"" Claire. The children!"
Cameron,"Yes, children are very impressionable. You'll never know what they'll pick up."
Mitchell,"Okay, Cam, I'm sorry that I blamed it on you, okay? But we both need to look at our actions. I mean, if we're thinking about adopting another baby, then we need to..."
Phil,You guys... you're adopting another kid?
Mitchell,"No! No, no! You're..."
Cameron,wait!
Gloria,Congratulations!
Mitchell,We're thinking about it. It's not...
Claire,"Oh, wow!"
Jay,What the hell's happening here?
Phil,"Is that from ""Footloose""?"
Cameron,"Really, Mitchell? You couldn't even share telling your family! Fine. Fine."
Gloria,But why are you upset? This is such good news.
Mitchell,"No, we're a little on edge because Lily has been acting out like she doesn't want a sibling, and..."
Cameron,"Yeah, because Mitchell taught her to hate sharing."
Mitchell,And/or because Cam wears her like a fanny pack.
Jay,"Oh, stop blaming each other. No kid wants a sibling. I mean, Claire hated you so much she stuck you in a dryer when you were two."
Mitchell,You put me in the dryer?
Claire,"I did, but it wasn't 'cause I hated you. My friend Marci said that it wouldn't run with a kid inside it, and I knew it would. I was right."
Phil,Good governor. It's been going on since you were five?
Claire,"Oh, my God. It is a sickness."
Phil,Yeah.
Claire,What would make me have that need at such a young age?
Mitchell,"How long was I in that dryer? Because I... is this why I'm afraid of tumbling? I had to quit gymnastics, Claire!"
Phil,A childhood without tumbling?
Claire,Ohh.
Phil,You knew this and just stood by and did nothing?!
Jay,"Okay, okay. What's done is done! All you can do is learn from your mistakes. And in that spirit, I would like to propose a toast... to Manny. This week, he did something he wasn't supposed to do, like we all do..."
Gloria,Like we all do! Salud to Manny!
Jay,"Uh, not yet. But Manny stood up like a man. He admitted he was wrong and he took his licks, and I'm damn proud of him."
Gloria,"Ah, now we clink!"
Jay,"No, we clink when I say we clink. So Manny made a mistake, but he didn't take the easy way out. He's got guts, he's got integrity. As far as I'm concerned, he's the best little b..."
Manny,"Okay, stop! Stop! I didn't do any of that. Mom broke into the locker and threw the necklace inside, and then we ran away like cowards. I'm sorry, Jay! I'm sorry!"
Jay,I knew it! I was right! I was right!
Luke,Who is it?
Claire,"Oh! Hi, honey. It's just me. Are you okay?"
Luke,Yeah. I'm great.
Claire,"So, how you liking your new digs?"
Luke,I know you told me that I'd be cold... And scared...
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Luke,But I'm not.
Claire,"No, I can see that. I was... I was wrong."
Luke,You were.
Claire,"Yeah. Well, you're gonna hate this then, honey, but I'm gonna need you to go back down and sleep in your old room. I just... I'm worried if you get something so cool this early in your life, you're not gonna have anything to look forward to later."
Luke,I-I have to go now?
Claire,You can spend the night tonight here if you want.
Luke,"Oh! No, if it's so important to you, I'll go now. You should come, too. Something sleeps over there."
Claire,Wait for me. Wait. Wait for me! Wait for me.
Gloria,Jay. Jay?
Jay,What? What's wrong?
Gloria,You're snoring.
Jay,"Me? Oh, I'm sorry. I... Look at her!"
Gloria,"Come on, we said no Stella in the bed."
Jay,"Oh, but she's just a little puppy. She probably got scared and snuck in."
Gloria,"Oh, really? How come when Manny has nightmares you don't let him snuck in the bed?"
Jay,"Gloria, it's 6:00 in the morning. Can we talk about this later?"
Manny,"Answer the question, Jay."
Mitchell,"You know, I'm gonna check the lease, but I'm pretty sure we're not allowed to have a meth lab."
Jay,You are a delight.
Mitchell,So what are you doing?
Cameron,I think you're gonna like this. I'm going on a juice fast.
Mitchell,Mmm. Love it.
Mitchell,"Hate it. Let's face it, a well-fed Cam is hardly a model of emotional stability. Now deprive him of food, and stage by stage, it's a slow descent into madness. Stage one... the clean sweep."
Cameron,Poison. Poison. Poison.
Mitchell,Do you think that this is the best week to be doing this?
Cameron,Why not?
Mitchell,"Well, we have that charity thing at my boss' house."
Cameron,"Oh, so what, I'm supposed to put off my quest for wellness until we're no longer socially in demand? That will never happen. I'm too charismatic."
Mitchell,No. No. Not the cookies.
Cameron,Of course the cookies. Why do you always want me to fail?
Mitchell,"Stage two... attack Mitchell. Because when his diet crashes and burns into a giant pile of Nutella, I'm the one he's gonna blame. Well, no, not this time."
Mitchell,"You know what? I'm gonna do the fast with you. I think it's a great idea, and we should do it together so we're on the same team, you know, us versus food."
Cameron,I know what you're doing... And I really appreciate it.
Mitchell,"No, it'll... it'll be good for me. I've actually put on a few pounds."
Cameron,"Yeah, well, you know, I didn't want to say anything."
Phil,How awesome are people?
Luke,So awesome.
Phil,"You wanna get that, buddy? I'll pause it."
Mitchell,"Hey, Luke. How's it going? I..."
Luke,"Hey, Uncle Mitchell. I really can't talk. I'm trying to watch a movie."
Mitchell,"Oh, okay, well, I just wanted to drop off this bag of junk food."
Luke,Go on.
Mitchell,"Uh, Cam and I are on a juice fast, so having this stuff in the house..."
Luke,I connected the dots. See ya.
Mitchell,Oh.
Phil,"Seeing that weird, wonderful little man pursuing his dream of walking on a tightrope made me think maybe I could pursue my dream..."
Phil,"Here you go, buddy."
Phil,... Of walking on a tightrope.
Luke,"come on, Dad! You got this! You can do this! Stay focused! Stay hungry!"
Phil,"You okay, buddy?"
Luke,"What? Yeah, hell, yeah, no. Just proud of my Dad!"
Luke,There was a lot of chocolate in that bag.
Claire,"Phil, honey, you gotta take Luke to school."
Phil,"Got it. Okay, I haven't fallen three out of the last four times. This afternoon, we go airborne."
Luke,Yeah!
Phil,Yeah! Yeah!
Haley,"Sitting all by yourself at the table. Now where have I seen that again? Oh, right. Every day in the school cafeteria."
Alex,I do that by choice.
Haley,The school's choice.
Alex,Isn't that your nickname?
Claire,"Haley, be nice to your sister. Alex, good save."
Alex,"Mom, sign this."
Claire,"What is it? They finally bumped me up to the harder math class. Third period, Mr. waters."
Haley,"What? No, Mom, you cannot sign this. This is my class. You're a freshman. What are you doing in second-year math?"
Alex,You're a senior. What are you still doing in second year math?
Haley,"Not ""still!""... Again."""
Claire,"Alex, be nice to your sister. Haley, not a good save."
Haley,I knew it would suck having you at my school.
Claire,"Well, hang in there. A couple more years, you'll have it all to yourself again. Come on, girls."
Gloria,"Jay, look at this. It's ruined. Stella did this. She chew on my shoe! You have to discipline that stupid dog."
Jay,I discipline her all the time.
Gloria,"Oh, really? How? By buying her little cupcakes?"
Jay,They're not real cupcakes. They're doggy treats in the form of cupcakes.
Gloria,"Yeah, you should have told that to Manny before he ate one."
Jay,"Oh, come on. His coat never looked better."
Gloria,You wouldn't find it so funny if she was destroying your shoes.
Jay,"Well, I don't leave my shoes laying around, so..."
Gloria,So it's my fault that she chooses to chew my shoe?
Jay,I didn't say that.
Gloria,: You barely said it. You have to stop coddling her.
Jay,I don't coddle her. What? She tries to drink the water. It's funny.
Haley,You don't look at me in class. You don't text me.
Alex,Who would text during a class?
Haley,What are you?
Claire,"Honey, I realize that this situation is not ideal for either one of you, but sometimes we just rise above things. Yes?"
Claire,"Uh, no, I did not."
Claire,"Okay, well, I was just dropping off my kids."
Claire,"Well, we were chatting. At the risk of surprising you a third time, officer, I've been dropping off here for years, and I..."
Claire,Okay. You betcha.
Alex,What was her problem?
Haley,"Oh, you know what you should have said to her..."
Claire,"Nothing. I should have said nothing would be the point. I have to see her every day. I mean, why make it worse? That's exactly what I'm talking about. Awkward, unpleasant situation... Rise above. Have a nice day."
Haley,Yeah.
Claire,"Love you! Bye-bye! ""And yet I see no children emerging from the vehicle."" How'd you like to see my fist emerging into your face? Oh! Now I think of it!"
Mitchell,"Day four of the juice fast, and I'm hungry, but I'm... I'm feeling pretty good. Cam, on the other hand, has gone all... ""Girl, interrupted."" After one, throwing out all of our food, and two, blaming me, he entered stage three... soap actress."
Cameron,I just wish my sister would put herself out there more. She has so much to offer. Why are men so superficial?
Mitchell,That was followed by stage four... a rush of epiphanies...
Cameron,I... don't... need... food. Look at this. Architecture is everywhere. Oh. Spaniards make amazing athletes.
Mitchell,Into stage five... despair...
Cameron,"Daddy, we hided, but you didn't seek."
Mitchell,Cam?
Mitchell,Then came rage.
Cameron,Oh. Ow. Oh.
Mitchell,Hey. Whatcha got there?
Mitchell,"The good news is, Cam's never made it this far into a diet before, so... Downside... I have no idea what the next stage is gonna be. But I'm pretty sure it's not charming party guest."
Mitchell,"Cam, I-I was thinking, I'll take the bullet tomorrow night at my boss' house. You don't have to go to the party. They're... they're boring. Silly cause, you know, lots of people. Parking... Cam, say something."
Cameron,Why do you hate me?
Mitchell,I don't hate you.
Cameron,Then why are you trying to push me out of your life?
Mitchell,Because you... you seem a little... Unhinged.
Cameron,"Okay, well, you know what I think? You should worry a little bit less about me and a little bit more about yourself and what you're gonna wear tomorrow night, because I saw what you have laid out, and I don't think you're gonna like the way you look in photos."
Mitchell,"Well, I hadn't landed on that."
Haley,"Her hand's in the air, like, every five seconds, and she actually reminded Mr. Waters to assign homework. The class loved that. Do you know how embarrassed I was?"
Alex,"Not as embarrassed as I was when she said 8 was a prime number. 8, Mom."
Claire,"Okay, fine. You know what? I'm gonna call the school today and have your schedules changed, but I want you to know a little part of me died today, okay? I thought the two of you could understand how being in the same class would benefit you both. Alex, you... you could've tutored Haley. Haley, you could've helped Alex with her social skills. Come on. The two of you could've been two Super Dunphys. And instead, what are you? Two bickering half- Dunphys, and I'm the fool that expected more. No, I don't even want to hear it. Just go upstairs. Go."
Phil,Wow. What was that?
Claire,"That was a master class in parenting. Right now our daughters are upstairs making a decision they think is their own, but really, it was an idea that was skillfully implanted by me."
Phil,"Inception, Claire. Dangerous game, but I like it."
Claire,Mm. What are those?
Phil,"Wire walkers. You want to go to the dance, you gotta wear the shoes. Luke, grab your camera. Luke."
Luke,I wasn't sleeping.
Claire,"Honey, I-I think those are... jazz shoes."
Phil,No. Tightrope shoes. Got 'em at an estate sale. Only worn once.
Claire,"That... that is not a ringing endorsement for... Oh! Phil, honey. Please be ca--careful. Right. Watch the door."
Haley,"Hey, what'd you get for number 3?"
Alex,You're not going to learn if I just give you answers.
Haley,"Well, what if I gave you something in return?"
Alex,Like what?
Haley,You can talk to me in class.
Alex,I want lunch at the cool table.
Haley,Then I want all the answers.
Alex,Then I want a week at the table.
Haley,That'll cost you two pop quizzes. month. The midterm.
Alex,Deal.
Luke,"Looking great, Dad."
Phil,"With these steps, I break the surly bonds... Chicken in a basket! Don't look at me."
Alex,Mom. Mom. Mom.
Claire,What? What? What? What? What?
Alex,Mom. Did you call the school yet?
Claire,"Uh, not yet, but I was just about to."
Phil,"Uh, Bartles & Jaymes!"
Alex,Good. Because we are thinking we might want to stay in that class.
Claire,"Really? Oh, girls, I don't know about that."
Haley,"Oh, please let us try it. Super Dunphy?"
Phil,I can't hold her! I can't hold her!
Claire,"Well, maybe one more week."
Haley,"Thanks, Mom."
Gloria,"I don't know. Uh, a cup of soup, a Cobb salad. Yeah, it had bacon. Cam, I don't have all day to describe all my meals to you. Stop eating all my things, you stupid animal. No, Cam, not you. I'll call you back. Bad doggy! You want to chew on something? Okay. Okay. Okay. Look at this. Look at this delicious man shoe. Eat it. Come on. Eat it. Eat it. Mmm! Yummy. Eat the shoe. Eat his shoe. Come on. Eat his shoe. Num, num, num, num. Num, num. Yeah, like this. Look. Ah. Delicious."
Manny,Mom?
Jay,Drop it.
Gloria,I...
Jay,Please. I'm sorry you had to see this.
Claire,Hello?
Claire,Yes.
Claire,"Hi, John. What'd she do this time?"
Claire,Both of them? Really?
Claire,I-I don't believe it.
Claire,"Um, I'm so sorry, John, and honestly, I-I really am a better mother than this. I promise."
Claire,"Mm-hmm. Seriously? Seriously?? Oh. You... Excuse me. Hey, um, what the hell is this?"
Claire,"Yeah, I know, but I was talking on the phone to the school that my kids were about to come out of, so..."
Claire,"N-no, I'm not."
Claire,"You know what? I do want to do some unloading. I know your type. Life has been bad to you. It has made you feel small. And then one day somebody gives you a fake cop outfit, a toy badge and a little spongebob tie."
Luke,"I'm really sorry, Dad."
Phil,"Oh, it's all right. Everybody throws up at school. If I had a nickel for every time I puked at school, you know how much money I'd have?"
Luke,35 cents.
Phil,"Exactly. Now go get cleaned up, and I'll call the doctor."
Luke,"Wait, Dad, I don't need a doctor."
Phil,What's up?
Luke,"The other day, Uncle Mitchell brought over a bag of junk food so he and Cam could do a Jew fast."
Phil,Juice fast?
Luke,"I'm pretty sure he said ""Jew."" But anyway, I took the bag, and I hid it, and I ate it all."
Phil,"Oh, buddy."
Luke,I couldn't help myself. I'm weak. Don't look at me.
Phil,"It's all right. It's okay. Hey, you learned a lesson. A painful lesson. I guess we both have."
Luke,What do you mean?
Phil,"I always saw myself as a guy who could soar through the sky, dancing on a wire. I can't even get across 1/6 inches off the ground."
Luke,"Well, maybe that's the problem. Maybe you keep falling because part of you knows that you can fall. Maybe if the wire was much, much higher, you wouldn't fall."
Phil,"Oh, Luke, Luke, Luke. You are a genius. Come on. We got work to do."
Luke,Yes! Can I have a doughnut first?
Phil,"Yes, you can!"
Claire,"Ah, there they are, my Super Dunphys."
Haley,"We're sorry, but we just..."
Claire,"Unh-unh-unh. You don't get to talk. You had a chance to be better people today. You, to be more well-rounded, and you, to be a better student. You could have elevated the Dunphy name, but instead, you chose to tarnish it, so, congratulations, ladies, you brought this family to a new low."
Alex,"Mom, are you..."
Claire,"Yeah. Yeah, I am, and I would actually like to get these loosened up, if I might."
Claire,"No, ma'am."
Claire,"All good, Janet. All good."
Cameron,"No, thank you."
Cameron,Walk away.
Mitchell,"It's tough enough to deal with Cam when I'm at full strength, but I have been fasting just as long as he has, and I do not have the energy to deal with a big, needy brisketcase... brass... basketcase."
Mitchell,"Cam! Don't be mad at me, but I think that you really need to eat something."
Cameron,"What? You're supposed to be my support. Oh, away from me, temptress. And I never thought I would call you that in a negative way."
Manny,"I've seen her do a lot of crazy stuff, but this is a whole new level. Is this a people cookie?"
Jay,You're good.
Manny,"A definitive ""yes"" or ""no"" would be appreciated. Those cupcakes did a number on me."
Gloria,Are you happy? You have reduced me to a person who eats a shoe.
Jay,"Gloria, sit."
Gloria,You think this is funny? To talk to me like I am a dog?
Jay,I'm not talking to you like you're a dog. I'm just asking you to sit so we can get to the bottom of this.
Gloria,"Okay, fine."
Jay,Good girl.
Gloria,Come on. You set me up.
Jay,"Gloria, why are you acting so crazy? It's just a little dog."
Gloria,It's not the little dog that is making me crazy. It's you that is making me crazy.
Jay,Me?
Gloria,"Yeah, you used to put me first. You used to want me in that shower."
Manny,Should I be here for this?
Gloria,"No, Manny. It's okay. I go. But I want you to know this. Where I come from, men cherish woman. It goes wife, mistress, dog. Dog always at the bottom."
Cameron,"Oh, God, I do not like where this is going."
Cameron,"Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God."
Mitchell,"Shh, shh."
Cameron,Don't say it. Don't you dare say it.
Cameron,"Ohh. This is the saddest thing I've ever... Mitchell, are you okay?"
Mitchell,Of course I'm not okay. None of this is okay.
Cameron,"Okay, well, you need to pull yourself together 'cause we're at your boss' house."
Mitchell,"He drowned, Cam!"
Cameron,"Yeah, yeah, I just think he needs a little air."
Mitchell,You know who else needed air? Snorkels!
Cameron,Excuse me.
Mitchell,"Snorkels?! Where are you, Snorkels?!"
Cameron,"Mitchell, get back here!"
Mitchell,"Oh, Snorkels!"
Cameron,"Mitchell, what is wrong with you?!"
Mitchell,What do you think is wrong with me? I'm starving!
Cameron,"Well, if you're starving, then just eat something!"
Mitchell,"I can't eat something because then you'll get mad at me, and we're at my boss' house!"
Cameron,I'm not gonna get mad at you! I appreciate what you're doing for me! I'm doing it for you.
Mitchell,"Oh, you don't have to do anything for me. I love you just the way you are."
Cameron,"I love you just the way you are. I got you! I got you, babe!"
Mitchell,Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Cameron,I got you!
Mitchell,"Cam, I can walk. I can walk."
Cameron,I got you!
Alex,"I let down my Mom and Dad today, and... worse than that, I let down my teacher."
Haley,It's all my fault. Everything I touch turns to Detention.
Alex,"I'm sorry, Mom."
Haley,"Me, too."
Claire,"Oh, I don't really have a whole lot of moral high ground to stand on. I wasn't exactly my best self today either. All in all, not a great day for the Dunphys."
Luke,"Come on, Dad! Believe in yourself! You're making the impossible unimpossible."
Claire,"Phil. Oh, my God."
Luke,Don't even bother. He's in the zone. He can't hear you.
Alex,"Go, Dad!"
Haley,You got this!
Claire,"All week long, I'd been telling my girls how to act instead of showing them, but not Phil. Phil could have said, Or ""Haley, challenge yourself. Don't give up so easily."" But instead of talking the talk. Phil walked the walk. And isn't that what we're supposed to do for the people we love? It's definitely a challenge... But Phil made it look easy seven feet off the ground."
Alex,You're awesome!
Phil,"Oh, my goodness!"
Claire,"Turns out, I've had my Super Dunphy all along."
Alex,Yeah!
Phil,"What was on my mind as I was walking across that wire? I kept thinking, if I can do this, then I've got two ways of getting across my yard."
Gloria,Did you have fun?
Gloria,"Yeah, I heard you the first time."
Jay,Let's go find your daddies.
Mitchell,"We're in here! Oh, my God. These cupcakes are so good."
Cameron,I'm so sorry. We helped ourselves. We were so hungry. They are delicious.
Mitchell,"I love that they're not too sweet, you know?"
Cameron,"Mmm. Mmm. They taste almost like pate. You know, I mean..."
Cameron,"We've been on a juice cleanse. You need to mind your own business, sweetie, for right now."
Alex,So then what happened?
Haley,Well she didn't show up to school the next day... and... I heard that she slept over at his dorm.
Alex,No Way!
Haley,"Seriously, are you surprised? Do you not know Carly? Have you seen what she wears to school?"
Claire,"Girls, lets cool it on the gossip. Okay? It's not right and Carly's got enough problems."
Haley,What do you mean?
Claire,Well ... her mom can't get through soccer practice Without a thermos of chardonnay... And don't get me started on the dad. That guy is...
Claire,"Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!"
Alex,Mom!
Claire,Oh! This is such a dangerous intersection!
Haley,Did I get lipstick on my face?
Alex,"No, you're fine. And consider yourself lucky You didn't just get, like, felt up by your mom."
Claire,They need to get a stop sign.
Alex,What is your obsession with traffic?
Claire,"It's an obsession with safety. One of these days, Joe Speeder's gonna come tearing through here, and somebody's gonna... Aah!"
Phil,I'm okay.
Claire,"Oh! Oh, my god!"
Phil,"I'm okay. Oh, hey, guys."
Claire,Phil?
Phil,"Yeah. No, I'm good. Gotta keep moving. Keep the heart rate up."
Claire,Oh. Okay.
Haley,How's my face?
Alex,Still good.
Haley,Okay. Good.
Jay,"Gloria, how many times do I have to tell you to pull your car all the way in? The gate was open all night."
Gloria,We live in a nice neighborhood. What are you afraid of? That some money's gonna fly in and then your gardener is gonna have to rake it up?
Manny,"Jay, I'm going to need you to cut me a check."
Jay,What now?
Manny,"Drama club trip. ""Les Miserables."" We're selling wrapping paper to raise money for the tickets."
Jay,No. No. Wait. Wait. Slow down. What's the story exactly?
Manny,"Well, Jean Valjean spent 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread."
Jay,The wrapping paper.
Gloria,19 years for a loaf of bread? How good was this bread?
Manny,It wasn't about the bread. It was about the society...
Jay,"Focus, people."
Gloria,"Manny, we will buy all your wrapping paper."
Jay,"No. No, we won't. No, he's got to learn to sell. This is the best business training there is, Hell, the best life training. Manny, write this down... ""A good salesman goes after Moby Dick in a rowboat and brings the tartar sauce with him."""
Manny,"Jay is always telling me to ""Write this down."" I don't always catch everything he says. ""Something, something, firm handshake."" ""Never take the first room they show you."" Not sure who ""They"" is. And this one just says ""Pancakes."""
Mitchell,"Cam, what's this scribble on the ""Vanity fair"" about an adoption agency?"
Cameron,"Oh, uh, yeah, they called to say they wanted to reschedule our home visit."
Mitchell,When? Why didn't you tell me? Th-this is kind of important.
Cameron,"Well, when does it say?"
Mitchell,"Uh, well, who knows? It disappears into Jennifer Aniston's hair. You gotta get a better system."
Cameron,There is nothing wrong with my system. Ask me anything about any upcoming event. I can tell you when and where it is.
Mitchell,When is the adoption agency visit?
Cameron,"Okay. Is that a ""5"" or a curl? Oh, I hope Jen's finally found love."
Mitchell,What happened here?
Cameron,"Well, Lily and I woke up in a French mood, so we decided to whip up some crepes."
Mitchell,When are you gonna be in the mood to wipe up some crepes?
Cameron,"Oh, I know, it's a little messy, but... You know what? I'm gonna clean it up."
Mitchell,Okay.
Cameron,I'll clean it up.
Mitchell,Will you?
Cameron,Just say what's on your mind.
Mitchell,"You never clean up. Save the gasp. Cam, whenever you get creative in the kitchen, I'm the one who ends up cleaning it up, okay? The homemade pizza, fondue, molecular gastronomy. I'm still cleaning shrimp foam out of the curtains."
Cameron,"Okay, you know, Mitchell? Just go to work, okay? I'm gonna take Lily to school, and then when I get home, I'm gonna scrub this place like a crime scene, which it is, because you've murdered joy."
Phil,"Hey, buddy. What's up?"
Luke,"Hey, dad. Think fast."
Phil,"Oh, my god!"
Luke,"Oh, my god!"
Phil,"Oh, my god!"
Luke,"If we had that on tape, it'd be the greatest youtube video ever!"
Phil,"We'd get, like, a million hits. This is our double rainbow!"
Luke,We need to do it again.
Phil,"Oh, I would, buddy, but, uh, your mom's all over me to change a bunch of lightbulbs."
Luke,How many moms does it take to screw on a lightbulb?
Phil,I don't know.
Luke,"None, 'cause they get you to do it, sucker."
Phil,"I laughed, but... It hurt a little."
Alex,We're home!
Phil,"Us, too."
Claire,"Oh, great. You're all here."
Phil,"What's up, girl?"
Claire,Oh. You know that really dangerous intersection?
Phil,"Where desire meets jealousy, and the result is murder?"
Claire,Mnh-mnh. The one where I almost killed you this morning.
Phil,"Oh, yeah. Sorry. That was my bad. I got lost in my jams. Dangerous combo... speed walking and speedwagon. Oh. I wasn't even trying for that."
Luke,Nice.
Claire,"Well, I am getting us a stop sign. I called City Hall, and how is this for amazing? The traffic committee meets tonight."
Alex,I've got goosebumps.
Claire,"I know, right? All I have to do is get 50 signatures, show up, make my case. It's on."
Phil,I am so proud of you.
Haley,We all are.
Claire,Mm.
Alex,"We love when mom gets on a project because usually the minute any of us walks in the door, she gives us something to do."
Haley,"""Do your homework."
Alex,"Clean your room."""
Luke,"""Put on pants."""
Phil,"Like the queen's coming over. Am I right? So when she's not around or gets busy, Luke and I capitalize on the situation."
Phil,"There you are, my good man. Squire, let's do it. Get you some!"
Alex,"Well, I think it's awesome."
Claire,I am so glad because I could really use your help getting these signatures.
Phil,"I'll do it, soon as I change those lightbulbs you wanted."
Claire,Great. Kids?
Alex,"Crud. You know, I've got a ton of homework."
Luke,"Uh, science project."
Claire,Haley?
Haley,I need to get started on my college essay. You know what? Maybe I'll write it about you. You're just so inspirational. Girl power! You rock.
Claire,"Thanks, honey. I do rock."
Gloria,"Stella, down. Stella, no. This is very dangerous. Okay, señorita. That's it. Come here, because Jay is gonna be very mad if something happens to you. Ay, tener que cuidar perro ahora. ¡Qué belleza! Go play with the bone. See you later. Now I can cook my empanadas. The gate. Ay, no! Ay, no! The gate! The gate! Estella, come back!"
Jay,"Hey there, Mr. Salesman."
Manny,Can we not talk about business?
Jay,"That bad, huh?"
Manny,"I gave it everything I got... Working the dimples, going big eyes. It got me two things... diddly and squat."
Jay,How many houses you hit?
Manny,I don't know. Must've been at least three.
Jay,Three? And that's your idea of the best you got?
Manny,It was very hard on me. I'm not used to rejection... Or hills.
Jay,"Look, you can't quit after three houses. That's... that's not perseverance. What are you selling?"
Manny,Wrapping paper.
Jay,"Wrong. You're selling Christmas... The excitement of opening presents, the taste of eggnog."
Manny,I do love eggnog.
Jay,"Look, write this down... ""What's the difference between 'try' and 'triumph'?"""
Manny,A little oomph?
Jay,A little oomph. Get it?
Manny,Of course I get it. I just said it.
Gloria,"Hey! I'm gonna kill you when I find you, silly dog! Why don't you come back? Stella!"
Cameron,I have a theory.
Gloria,"Ay, Cam, thank you for helping me."
Cameron,"Oh, it's my pleasure. Stella! Stella! Oh, my god."
Gloria,What? Do you see her?
Cameron,No. But I see myself in the role I was born to play. Stella! Stella!
Cameron,"Hello? Oh, Mitchell, you are not gonna believe this. I'm out helping Gloria look for her dog. I'm wearing an undershirt and I'm screaming ""Stella,"" just like in ""Streetcar."" Hello?"
Mitchell,You didn't clean the kitchen.
Cameron,"Mitchell, I am an inadvertent Stanley Kowalski. How can you not be delighted by this?"
Mitchell,You promised.
Cameron,"I was called away for an emergency. Gloria's lost her dog, and she's heartbroken."
Gloria,"Where are you, dumb dog? I hope in a big, black hole."
Mitchell,I cannot believe that you did this to me yet again. Oh.
Cameron,I didn't do anything. I cooked a meal in our kitchen.
Mitchell,"And then you left on purpose, knowing that I would not be able to sit here without cleaning it up."
Cameron,Life is messy sometimes. Big deal. It gets cleaned up. You're the one with a problem if you can't leave a few dirty dishes for a couple hours.
Mitchell,"O-okay, fine. C-Cam, I'm not cleaning it up."
Cameron,Great.
Mitchell,I mean it.
Cameron,Perfect. You know what? Why don't you make it bigger?
Mitchell,"You know what? I will. I-I... Okay, you know, get... get ready, because you are gonna come home to... to a giant mess."
Cameron,And I will give him a giant hug when I get there. Stella!
Luke,"Hey, dad. Think fast."
Phil,"Oh. Wow. Buddy. I'm sorry. I told you, I gotta change the lightbulbs and then help your mom with those signatures."
Luke,Never mind. I guess it was a stupid idea anyways.
Phil,"I've always said that if my son thinks of me as one of his idiot friends, then I've succeeded as a dad. If he wants to go the wrong way on the escalator, I'm on board. If he wants to go into a restaurant and pretend we're Australian, toss a few shrimp on the Barbie for me and my Joey. Yeah? Right? Nicole Kidman? Men at work?"
Phil,"Here we go. Take 12. Hey, buddy! I'm home!"
Luke,"Hey, dad. Think fast. Wow. You know, my arm's starting to hurt a little."
Phil,Really? 'Cause my face feels great.
Luke,"Come on, dad. Let's not turn on each other. We could be here a while."
Phil,Yeah. Okay. You're right. Here we go. Take nine.
Luke,You're not even trying.
Mitchell,"What do you want, honey?"
Mitchell,"All right well, go get 'em."
Mitchell,"For the record, I am not a neat freak. I-in fact, in my first long-term relationship, I was the messy one, which is why she broke up with me. Well..."
Manny,Okay.
Jay,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me show you how it's done. Hi. Uh, Jay Pritchett here. Holidays are just around the corner."
Jay,What do you mean you don't believe in wrapping paper? It's not Bigfoot. It exists.
Jay,"No, not this stuff. This paper was made from 100% recycled materials."
Manny,I don't think so.
Gloria,She's an ugly little fresh bulldog with the tiny ears and the smushy face. What is so hard to understand?
Cameron,Maybe I should translate.
Claire,"I understand, but a stop sign is really important. What exactly are you carving?"
Manny,"Hello, ma'am. Do you love christmas?"
Manny,"Oh, well, then you must appreciate a good value."
Jay,"Oh, jeez."
Cameron,"If you see her, let us know."
Claire,"Oh, my god. No, no. No, no. Are you kidding? Seriously?!"
Luke,See? You're not keeping your head in the right position.
Phil,"I know that's me, but I'm not remembering any of this."
Claire,Oh. Those stupid neighbors!
Phil,What's wrong?
Claire,"I can't ask for a simple signature, but it's fine for them to build a house that looks like the Beverly Hillbillies just moved in. Did you do any better?"
Phil,"We came close a few times, but you're not talking about the basketball, are you?"
Claire,"Phil, tell me you got some signatures. I have to be at City Hall in, like, two hours. Oh, god. Haley, how about you?"
Haley,I've been busy with my college essay.
Claire,Really? Where is it?
Haley,"It's in a rough, rough draft right now. I've been thinking that maybe that I should... Alex has been skyping with her boyfriend since you left."
Alex,That's so not true!
Claire,"Thank you. Really, thank all of you so much for your help. Really?"
Phil,"Sometimes those things need to warm up, like the car."
Claire,"Phil, don't even. I have been out there, trying to do something good for our community, because let me tell you, change doesn't just happen. It is forged by empowered women like me and Norma Rae and the lady from ""The Blind Side."" Do you know what the difference is between me and her? Blind side's family had her back."
Phil,"Okay. Huddle up, everybody. Your mother's right. She's the quarterback of this family, and we need to protect her like blind side did."
Luke,She just said the mom was blind side.
Phil,"Well, she's confused. Blind side was the black kid who played tight end."
Alex,Offense line.
Phil,Sorry. African-american kid.
Gloria,"There she is. Ay! Stella! Ay, thank god you found my dog. Thank you."
Gloria,"No, it's not. Her name is Stella. It says right here on the tag. Look."
Cameron,"Uh, uh, uh, excuse me. Hi, sweetie. What's your name?"
Cameron,"Shut up. Mitchell would die. Listen, we don't know you. You seem like a very sweet little girl, and right now we're forced to... I can't believe I'm saying this to you... rely on the kindness of strangers."
Gloria,That's it. Give me my dog.
Gloria,"Oh, really? The little girl thinks because she can scream, she can get away with everything? I can scream, too. Aah!"
Cameron,Aah!
Jay,What the hell sound is that?
Manny,"Coyotes must've got a cat. Jay, can we stop now? I'm getting hungry."
Jay,You know what the problem is? You're not hungry.
Manny,I had a carrot at 3:00.
Jay,What if you couldn't feed your family unless you made this next sale? What if you were gonna lose your house?
Jay,"I know I was pushing the kid hard, but here's the thing... I'm an older dad. I'm not gonna be around forever. And I'll sleep better knowing he's got something to fall back on."
Jay,Come on! Let's hit another one.
Manny,I can't do it.
Jay,What?
Manny,I don't have what it takes.
Jay,What kind of talk is that?
Manny,"It's the truth, Jay. I'm not a great salesman. I'm not a great businessman. I'm not you. Do you know what it's like to see all the amazing things you've accomplished, knowing I never will? How am I supposed to live up to you? How is anyone?"
Jay,"Ah, so the fish weren't biting today. So what? That's life. You tried hard, and that's what matters."
Manny,Yeah.
Jay,"You know, I-I actually need some wrapping paper. You know where I can find some?"
Manny,You don't have to do that.
Jay,I want to do it.
Manny,You'll never go broke playing to a rich guy's ego... Write that down.
Claire,"Uh, hi. Oh, sorry. Um, I'm here for the traffic committee meeting?"
Claire,Yeah. Um...
Claire,"I'm sorry. Happy birthday. Uh, just... someone sent me to the wrong room, and you guys don't meet again for months, and this is pretty much a matter of life and death, so..."
Claire,Okay.
Claire,"Great. My name is Claire Dunphy, and my family and I live near that intersection of..."
Claire,"Uh, almost. I have 34, but I..."
Claire,Wow. I'm confused.
Claire,"Right. I get that. Sir, I'm trying to save lives here..."
Haley,Mom.
Haley,"Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom! Oh, my god."
Claire,What are you doing here? Girls.
Alex,We... we went door to door and we got you 20 more signatures.
Claire,That is so sweet of you.
Haley,"Well, you were freaking out at us, so..."
Claire,"Okay, you know, let's not ruin it. All right, 54 signatures. Okay. So what do you say? Let's start saving lives one intersection at a time."
Phil,Wait a minute. I know what that means.
Phil,"That's Washington-speak for ""Get lost."""
Claire,"Well, um, wow, Phil. What are you doing here?"
Phil,I'm your husband. I'm blindsiding you.
Claire,Uh...
Phil,"Your honor, permission to approach."
Claire,Not a judge.
Phil,"I'll get straight to the point because this is important, and that appears to be an ice cream cake."
Phil,"Okay. I present to you ""Stop in the name of life."" Kick it."
Phil,"Clive Bixby. Can I meet you at Harry's bar in two minutes? Baby, I can do anything in two minutes. I'll just speed through the intersection of Greenleaf and Bristol. It's easy 'cause there's no stop sign."
Luke,I love being a kid. I have my whole life ahead of me.
Phil,No!
Luke,No!
Claire,Okay. Well...
Phil,Powerful.
Claire,"And unconventional, but I believe it makes our point. So what do you say?"
Claire,"I understand, sir, but..."
Phil,"Allow me. Allow me. Ladies and gentlemen, I've lived with this woman for 20 years. If she wants a stop sign... there's gonna be a stop sign."
Haley,He's right.
Alex,Listen to the man.
Luke,Yeah.
Cameron,I'm home!
Mitchell,"Oh, hey. Did you find Stella?"
Cameron,Safe and sound.
Mitchell,Mm.
Cameron,Oh! Hey!
Mitchell,I did it! I left the mess. Aren't you proud of me?
Cameron,I sure am. Good for you!
Mitchell,"You know, it wasn't easy at first, but I just... I took Lily to the park, and I completely put it out of my mind. And I think I really cleared a hurdle today."
Cameron,"Oh, that's great. I'm super proud of you, And you're... and you're not even tempted to clean it up now?"
Mitchell,No!
Cameron,That's great.
Mitchell,"No, not now that you're home."
Cameron,So guess I'd better get started.
Mitchell,Yeah.
Cameron,I don't like it. It's so gross.
Mitchell,"Oh, my god."
Cameron,What?
Mitchell,I was right. You wanted me to clean it up.
Cameron,"Oh, that's preposterous. I will not stand here and take this from you."
Mitchell,"Oh, Cam! ""Life is messy. I love chaos."" You are so full of it. Well, you know what? That's all right. No worries. Hey, come on. Come on, just embrace it. It's life."
Cameron,"Oh, no§ Oh! Okay, now that is gratuitous."
Mitchell,"Oh, it's okay."
Cameron,No! That's Lily's favorite cereal. This is ridiculous.
Mitchell,"Relax! Hey, Lily! Honey, come here! Sweetheart, do you want a princess hat?"
Mitchell,Okay.
Cameron,"Oh. Oh, okay. That... that is enough! No! You've proven your point. I don't like to clean up. It's smelly, it's sticky, and after I eat, I'm tired, and I just want to lay down."
Mitchell,"And you put it off, knowing that I would do it?"
Cameron,Yes! Are you happy?
Mitchell,Yes... I... Am.
Mitchell,Oh!
Cameron,I might need to tweak my system.
Luke,"Hey, dad. Think fast."
Phil,"Sacagawea! Wait, wait, wait... I need a break. Oh! John Philip Sousa! Oh, my..."
Luke,78 views.
Phil,We are on our way.
Luke,"Yeah, we are."
Phil,"You know what, Lukey? My dad was away a lot. And I'm not gonna do that to you. I'm gonna be the kind of dad... How many more of these do you wanna do?"
Claire,"Oh, don't look. There's that jerk Duane Bailey."
Phil,"Oh, yuck."
Claire,"I should say something to him, shouldn't I?"
Phil,"I gotta be honest, I was just working off your tone. Who's Duane Bailey, and why do we hate him?"
Claire,"Honey, he's that councilman who shot down my stop sign. Big phony."
Phil,Yeah.
Phil,"Well, you just got it."
Claire,"No. You don't remember meeting me, do you? Claire Dunphy. Last month's town council meeting?"
Claire,"""Duane Bailey. Councilman. Citizen. Puggle breeder."""
Phil,"I like what he's saying, Claire."
Claire,He isn't saying anything.
Phil,Look at his...
Claire,We need a stop sign at our intersection.
Phil,He nailed it.
Cameron,"""Actor/writer/director who packs a punch."""
Mitchell,"Oh, Sylvester Stallone."
Cameron,"Sylvester Stallone. I said it first. Oh, my God. This guy brought his kids, Mitchell."
Mitchell,"What, to this movie? Isn't it supposed to be super violent?"
Cameron,"I'm sorry. I don't mean to overstep, but I don't know that this movie is really appropriate for children. I'm terrified to see it. That's why we're here during the day."
Cameron,Okay. I tried.
Mitchell,Yeah. All you can do.
Cameron,"You know, I've... I've read this book, and I know what's gonna happen, and it's very disturbing. I really think you might be inviting some pretty serious nightmares here."
Cameron,"Yeah, but I don't think you do."
Mitchell,"Cam. Cam. He says he's got it, all right? You said your piece. Just watch the movie."
Cameron,"Oh, uh,"
Mitchell,Gwyneth Paltrow.
Cameron,I really must insist you not traumatize your kids...
Mitchell,Cam.
Cameron,...by exposing them to gratuitous violence...
Mitchell,Stop it. Shh!
Cameron,...and graphic depictions of...
Cameron,"Yeah, well, you're gonna be. I'm gonna tell you one more time."
Mitchell,Okay.
Mitchell,"It was ""The muppet"" movie. We were in the wrong theater."
Cameron,"Enjoy the show. I was always a fan of the muppets, especially the two guys in the theater who wouldn't shut up."
Gloria,Hello?
Jay,I'm running late. This knucklehead's kept me waiting for over an hour. I never had to wait like this when his dad was running things.
Gloria,Yeah. And soda was a nickel. Just tell them that your family is coming over.
Jay,This guy fired his own father. He's not gonna care about my family.
Gloria,"Okay, then just leave. You don't need his money."
Jay,"Once a week, I have eight family members coming to my house for free food. I'm not going anywhere."
Gloria,Okay. I see you when I see you. Are you okay? What is wrong?
Manny,I want to be homeschooled.
Gloria,"Really, Manny? Do you want me to learn you English? What is going on?"
Manny,"I have a big report due, and the teachers don't seem to care about the substance. All they care about is the flash."
Gloria,"Manny, sometimes you can be a little bit old-fashioned. Remember the first time you saw the kids with the backpacks with wheels and you thought they were too flashy?"
Manny,"You're going to school, not boarding a flight to Denver. It's getting absurd. Reuben freestyle-rapped his report on Irish immigrants. That doesn't even make sense. Maybe you do a Riverdance. Maybe."
Gloria,What is your report on?
Manny,The mafia.
Gloria,Perfect. We do a papier-mache Tommy gun.
Manny,"Oh, no. We shouldn't have to jazz it up."
Gloria,"Okay, then we go upstairs and we get your old rocking horse and we chop the head off."
Manny,"No, that's a terrible idea. I love Brownie!"
Gloria,Do you want to send a message or not?
Gloria,"Jay never wants me to help him with his business, and now suddenly, Manny doesn't want to listen to me either. It's very frustrating. I have all the answers."
Jay,"How you doing, Joshie?"
Jay,Closets.
Jay,I thought that was implied.
Jay,"You want a nice closet with sharp design, quality materials, and expert craftsmanship."
Jay,I wanted to hang myself.
Jay,"Yeah, let's talk more specific. What exactly do you like and what don't you like?"
Jay,"I love your enthusiasm. Uh, before I go off in the wrong direction, how about an example?"
Jay,I don't think I need to hear any more.
Haley,Whatcha doing there? Homework?
Alex,What do you want?
Haley,I need to borrow some money. It's really important.
Alex,How much?
Haley,$900.
Alex,What?!
Haley,"Come on. If you were in trouble, I would do anything for you. We're not just sisters. We're best friends."
Alex,"Look, I would if I could, but I don't have any money. And since we're talking, I never told anyone this before, and it..."
Claire,...Wipe that smug smile off his stupid face.
Phil,His face is stupid.
Claire,Oh! I can't believe ridiculous people like him end up in office.
Phil,"Well, why don't you run? You're smart, you care about the community, and you're easy on the eyes when you put a little effort into it."
Claire,Are you serious?
Phil,"Yeah, you know, maybe change out of the sweaty gym clothes every once in while. I thought you were talking about running for office. Go on."
Claire,"I'd be lying if I said I'd never thought about it. I mean, I know it's a ridiculous little local thing, but it might be fun to get out there and contribute. Plus I think I'd be good at it."
Phil,You'd be great.
Claire,"Mm. How would this work? I mean, who would be here for the kids after school? Who would take them to practice and recitals and keep them from burning the house down?"
Phil,"It must be so hard being a single mom. Claire, I will. If you wanna fly, I'm not gonna hold your feet to the ground."
Claire,Hmm.
Phil,I wanna be the one to push you off the cliff.
Claire,I think I'm gonna do it.
Phil,Great. Go fly.
Claire,Phil.
Phil,No.
Claire,"Oh, Phil!"
Phil,"I'll admit it. I'm turned on by powerful women... Michelle Obama, Oprah, Condoleezza Rice,"
Cameron,Do you want a fry?
Mitchell,"No, I can't eat. We should've stayed and seen ""The muppets."" I can't even look at ketchup without seeing blood."
Cameron,"Ooh, runaway curly fry. You know these are good luck. Mm!"
Mitchell,Oh!
Cameron,"Oh, my God. What was that?"
Mitchell,We just got rear-ended.
Cameron,"Oh, pull off to the side street. Pull off to the side street."
Mitchell,Are you okay?
Cameron,"Oh, I think I cut the roof of my mouth on the straw. Oh, my God."
Mitchell,Mm!
Cameron,So yes.
Cameron,"W-well, I-I sustained a minor mouth injury."
Mitchell,We're fine. Thank you. It's...
Mitchell,Okay. Thank you.
Cameron,"Well, he seems nice."
Mitchell,Yeah.
Cameron,"You know, if this were a romantic comedy, this would be our meet cute. We'd spend the rest of the afternoon drinking wine, eating food, flying a kite, you know, doing montage-y stuff."
Mitchell,"Yeah, am I in this movie of yours?"
Cameron,"Yeah, you're the gay best friend."
Mitchell,"Oh, my God!"
Cameron,"Oh, my God! We have a runner!"
Mitchell,"Um, it's D-W-Y... I can't read it."
Cameron,Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
Mitchell,Go where?
Cameron,We have to chase him down!
Mitchell,"No, we're not supposed to do that!"
Cameron,Help! Stop that car! He's getting away! Help!
Mitchell,"Yeah, you almost got him, Cam. You almost got him."
Cameron,He's getting away!
Haley,Hey. Whatcha doing? Playing?
Luke,Yeah.
Haley,Do you have any money saved up?
Luke,I'm comfortable.
Luke,"I've saved $1,217. It wasn't even that hard."
Claire,Don't forget your lunch.
Luke,"Thanks, mom."
Claire,"Don't forget your lunch money, buddy."
Luke,"Thanks, dad."
Phil,You bet.
Haley,Please. It's really important.
Luke,"Look, I'd love to help you out, but I'm not very liquid right now."
Luke,It's in a block of ice. I got the idea when I heard about rich guys with frozen assets. Assets.
Claire,"I am running for town council, and I understand that I can pick up a form here."
Claire,You're joking. I just saw you in the parking lot two hours ago.
Claire,"I am entering the race for town council, and I am running against you."
Claire,"No, I plan on winning, so..."
Claire,"Why do I feel like this is a rhetorical question, and you're about to l..."
Claire,Really? 'Cause I feel like they just yip a lot.
Claire,"Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me. Hello? Anne. Haley did that? Oh, God. Okay. Um... I'll call you right back. For your information, sir, I am no bored housewife. No, I-I would kill for ""bored."" Why isn't this lighting up?"
Luke,"Dad, I cut my arm."
Phil,"Oh, wow. You sure did, buddy. I'll get you fixed up."
Luke,Where's mom?
Phil,She belongs to the people now.
Alex,My allergies are acting up again.
Phil,"Well, it is your lucky day, because, missy, Dr. Dad has everything you need. Behold the healing powers of grape flavoring."
Alex,Where's mom?
Luke,Some people took her.
Phil,"Drink this. Listen, guys, your mom is taking on more responsibilities outside of the... house, but don't you worry. Good old... dad... Oh, my goodness!"
Luke,Ow!
Phil,I'm so sorry!
Luke,You punched me!
Alex,"Dad, you gave me the drowsy kind."
Phil,There's a drowsy kind?!
Alex,I have to study for a test!
Luke,Oh! It really hurts!
Phil,"Well, I'll get you some ice."
Luke,"No. No, no, no. I'll get it."
Gloria,"Oh, you made it. How was it?"
Jay,Eh.
Gloria,"Why? What's wrong, babe?"
Jay,I don't want to talk about it.
Gloria,Do it anyways.
Jay,"Uh, this stupid kid's been in the business about ten minutes. He barely looks at my proposal, and he says he wants more ""wow."""
Gloria,"What does he mean by more ""wow""?"
Manny,"It's the ""Bieber-ization"" of America."
Jay,What do beavers have to do with anything?
Gloria,"The beavers... they build the dams all over the country so there's no floods, is the ""beaver-ization"" of the Americas."
Manny,I'm finding there's less and less we can talk about.
Gloria,So why didn't you tell him that you've been in the business for such a long time...
Jay,It's not gonna make any difference. He wants to make a change. And I got a factory full of people depending on this.
Gloria,"Yeah, but maybe if you tell him that..."
Jay,"Gloria, please. I-I-I've had a tough day. Can we please not talk about it?"
Gloria,But I want to help.
Jay,Trust me. I wish you had the answers.
Gloria,I do!
Jay,"Hey, guys."
Haley,"Hey, grandpa."
Alex,"Hey, Jay."
Jay,What's with her?
Phil,Just tired. Growth spurt.
Cameron,"Hey, hey."
Jay,"Hi, guys. Hi, baby girl."
Gloria,"Hola, Lily. How are you?"
Cameron,"No, uh, we're not fighting."
Mitchell,"No, not at all, honey. No. Okay, uh, go play, sweetheart. Okay?"
Cameron,Let's go play with some blocks. Let's go stack some blocks.
Mitchell,"All right. Okay, the reason we're fighting is 'cause this one thinks he's dirty Harry."
Jay,Having a hard time picturing Clint Eastwood in that shirt.
Cameron,"Okay, let me ask you something. Today, at a stoplight, a guy ran into our car, and then just took off. I wanted to chase after him. Mitchell..."
Mitchell,Kept a level head and called the police.
Luke,Pfft. Police. Aren't they too busy winning the war on drugs?
Mitchell,"Okay, so which one of us did the right thing?"
Jay,Hit and run. Gotta chase him down.
Gloria,I chase the people all the time.
Mitchell,"No. No. That's... that's irresponsible and dangerous. Okay, well, what if he had been armed?"
Cameron,He wasn't armed. He had a Hillary bumper sticker.
Mitchell,This isn't an isolated incident. This morning he flipped out at somebody at The Muppet movie.
Mitchell,"Oh, no. No, honey. Just the first two numbers. No, Lily. Wait."
Claire,"Hi. Hi. Hi. Phil, where are you, honey? I need to talk to you. Do you know what our daughter did?"
Phil,Nothing. She's fine. She's reading.
Claire,"No, not her. Haley. Haley! Come over here. I want to talk to you."
Phil,There she is. Not a scratch on her.
Claire,Do you have something you want to say to us?
Haley,Uh...
Claire,Mmm... let me help you out here. Fake I.D.s?
Phil,What?!
Claire,Mm-hmm. Haley tried to get her and her friends some fake I.D.s.
Haley,I wasn't gonna use them for drinking. We just wanted to get into this club to see a band.
Claire,She took a bunch of money from them and then she lost it.
Phil,How much?
Alex,$900.
Phil,You're kidding me!
Claire,"Oh, my God! Oh!"
Haley,It's not my fault! I gave money to this guy. He's the one who ripped us off.
Claire,What happened to your face?
Luke,Oh. I ran into a door.
Phil,Yeah.
Claire,What happened to your face?
Luke,Dad hit me.
Phil,It was an accident. I was trying to open up a band-aid!
Claire,Phil! What's wrong with her?
Phil,Growth spurt.
Claire,What's wrong with her?
Phil,I drugged her.
Claire,Phil!
Phil,I accidentally gave her the nighttime allergy medicine.
Claire,"Mm. All right, one thing at a time. Haley, how are you going to repay your friends?"
Haley,I don't know.
Gloria,I know. You go there with a couple of guys...
Jay,She's gotta get the money back. Who is this kid?
Haley,A guy at school's cousin's friend. He lives in Gardena.
Mitchell,"Well, if you know where he lives, just call the police."
Phil,No cops. We can't afford a scandal right now. Claire's running for town council.
Claire,"That was before, when I thought you could take care of the children. I take my eye off the ball for one minute, and I've got one in a coma, one with a black eye, and one running a crime ring."
Gloria,"Well, to be fair, Haley started her crime ring when your eye was still on the ball."
Haley,It's not a crime ring. I just gotta get my hands on that $900.
Manny,I know how the mafia would handle this.
Jay,"The kid is right. I'm sick of these smart-ass punks who keep changing the rules and think they can get away with anything they want. I'm gonna pay this guy a visit. Haley, text me his address."
Phil,I'm going with you.
Cameron,"Me, too."
Mitchell,"Oh, no. No. Nobody's going anywhere. Okay, we're not vigilantes."
Cameron,Shotgun!
Mitchell,No! No weapons!
Gloria,"In my country, it is tradition... when the men are out seeking vengeance, the women... they stay home, and they drink."
Claire,Sometimes I think you just make this stuff up.
Gloria,Do you want a drink or not?
Claire,"Oh, yeah."
Gloria,"So what happened? You were running for office, and now you're not?"
Claire,Mm. I don't really want to talk about that.
Gloria,"I know. I am sick and tired of no one needing my help. You are going to tell me what is wrong, and I'm gonna give you the right answer, because I have all of them. So why are you not running for office?"
Claire,Because my family needs me too much. You saw what just happened.
Gloria,Why are you not running for office?
Claire,That doesn't work on me.
Gloria,Why are you not running for office?!
Claire,Because I don't want to lose! I... pfft! I haven't done anything outside of my house in 18 years. I don't want the first thing that I do to be a complete failure.
Gloria,"Okay. I'm gonna tell you a story about a little girl who entered a beauty pageant... Even though she was very, very scared that she was going to lose."
Claire,Let me guess. You won.
Gloria,"Of course I won, but I was talking about my cousin Maria Conchita. She had a nose like a toucan, she stuffed her body in this bikini, and at the end, she finished dead last."
Claire,How is that a good story?
Gloria,"Because she faced her fears, and it didn't kill her."
Claire,Hmm.
Gloria,What killed her two weeks later was a bus.
Claire,Are you serious?
Gloria,"Yes, because she couldn't see anything coming with that big nose."
Claire,This guy has won six elections. I am way out of my league.
Gloria,"Look, I don't know anything about this guy, but I know that you're a tough lady, and I come from a family of tough ladies. And I have to say, sometimes you scare me a little bit. And I know that you're strong enough to win and definitely strong enough to be okay if you lose."
Claire,I scare you?
Gloria,"Are you kidding me? ""I want Thanksgiving at my house!"""
Claire,Why does everybody think I talk like that?
Jay,This is it.
Mitchell,"W-w-wait. No, no. Come on. Do we have a plan? It doesn't seem like we have a plan."
Phil,"Yeah, I got a plan. Either he gives us the money, or he gets a private performance from england Dan and John Ford Coley."
Mitchell,That's not a good plan. That's not even a good band.
Jay,"If all you're gonna do is criticize, just wait by the car."
Mitchell,"Okay, fine. I'll see you in jail. It's gonna be a big adjustment for two of you."
Jay,Ugh.
Jay,You Peter?
Jay,You know Haley Dunphy? You owe her $900. We're here to collect.
Phil,You dig?
Phil,That does sound like Haley.
Cameron,So how are you gonna make this right?
Jay,That was easy.
Phil,"He's lucky he didn't put up a fight. I would've treated him to a reunion of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young!"
Cameron,We got a runner! Runner!
Mitchell,Stop! Stop! Stop! No. No. No. No. Oh! I got him!
Cameron,"Oh, my God. You did!"
Mitchell,Don't be so surprised. Help! He's slipping out of his skinny jeans. These are cute. I totally have these.
Jay,Hmm?
Phil,Ha ha ha!
Jay,There you go!
Haley,"Oh, you got it back! Thank you!"
Jay,"Hey, don't thank me. Thank your uncle Mitchell. He's the one who tackled the guy."
Mitchell,I got grass stains.
Haley,"Well, I will tell you one thing. I have learned my lesson. Disappointing my family and friends is punishment enough."
Phil,Nice try. You're grounded for two weeks.
Gloria,"Okay, we have big news. Claire has decided to run for mayor after all."
Claire,"Thank you, but it's town council."
Gloria,It doesn't matter. You're not going to win anyways. But she's going to be okay. You see? I help the people. Why don't you two let me help you?
Manny,"Well, I can't speak for Jay, but I guess I'm just too proud to ask for help."
Jay,Are you serious? She cuts your steak.
Gloria,What about you?
Jay,I don't want to bother you with my business.
Gloria,What else do I do every day?
Jay,I don't know. I'm guessing the gym and... one other thing?
Claire,"Dad, you should listen to her. She might really help you."
Jay,Huh.
Claire,She could be an asset.
Jay,Hmm.
Phil,Asset.
Luke,Heard it.
Gloria,And look at the shelves over here. They're for the shoes. Those are my favorite ones. So what do you think?
Jay,Same... exact... closet.
Cameron,"We never needed fake I.D.s on the farm. We figured if a 16-year-old could drive a tractor, he could drink a beer. Not at the same time, of course. It's Missouri, not Texas."
Mitchell,"I used a fake I.D. to get into an ""R""-rated movie... ""the fabulous Baker boys."" I found the title to be misleading. Lot of Michelle Pfeiffer... that's all I'm saying."
Jay,I remember when I got my fake I.D.
Phil,"Me, too. Crazy times."
Jay,"Hell, yeah. I tried to enlist in the army, but they saw right through me, so me and a bunch of guys drove across state lines, we got a bunch of booze, we loaded up on fireworks, and I woke up in the morning... I kid you not... in a Mexican strip joint. You?"
Phil,"Uh, I used mine to rent some bowling shoes and kept 'em. Suckers probably spent months trying to track down Dr. Richard Hertz. Think about it."
Phil,There she is! The old library. That's some late nights in there. Some of them I even spent studying. Don't tell your mom.
Haley,And maybe don't tell me.
Phil,College!
Haley,He was shielding his eyes from the sun.
Phil,Knew it when I hit it.
Claire,Phil is taking Haley to visit his Alma Mater.
Phil,Loved college.
Claire,"Mm, we were hoping some of that enthusiasm rubs off on her. Go, bullfrogs!"
Phil,Dogs. Bulldogs. I feel like you do that on purpose.
Claire,"No, it's just... I say ""bull, "" and I can't remember if it's frogs or dogs."
Phil,"When I talk to my old friends from college, do we croak or do we bark?"
Phil,I got it. Hello?
Phil,"No way! Haley, no way! Check it out! After a few beers, my buds and I would jump on these lunch trays and race down this same hill. Hop on."
Haley,I don't want to to hop on.
Phil,"Seriously, you'll get the giggles."
Haley,I don't want the giggles.
Phil,"Hey, honey."
Claire,How's the trip going?
Phil,So good.
Claire,"Go, bullfrogs."
Phil,It's dogs.
Claire,"Oh, sorry. How's Haley doing?"
Phil,"She's... she's loving it. She's loving it. I showed her the student union. We visited the dorms. We sat in on a class. I really think she's starting to see what college has to offer. Oh, hang on, Claire. Go, bulldogs!"
Gloria,"Manny, who is this Bella girl, and why is her name all over your notebook?"
Manny,"Bella's no girl, mom. She has recently blossomed, like a purple lilac in April."
Gloria,"What do you mean, she blossom? Like, the poo-berty?"
Manny,Yeah. I'll get it.
Jay,"Hey, Gloria, your show's about to start."
Gloria,Record it.
Jay,"No, the DVR's filling up. Let's just watch and get it over with."
Jay,Gloria's always saying we should do more stuff together. So I agreed to watch this crazy Colombian soap opera she loves.
Gloria,"""Fuego y hielo."""
Jay,"Which apparently, is Spanish for ""big hair and yelling."""
Gloria,"""Fire and ice."" It's about human suffering. I relate to it."
Jay,"I'm just saying, the guy's a judge. He can put a shirt on."
Gloria,"Ay, what is that?"
Manny,"Oh, nothing."
Gloria,That doesn't look like a nothing. What is inside?
Manny,"Oh, it's just something I bought. I'm gonna go open it in my room."
Gloria,I don't like this. Manny has never kept a secret from me.
Jay,Don't worry about it.
Gloria,What do you think it could be?
Jay,"Well, right now I'm a little worried it could be the rest of my evening."
Claire,Mwah! Bye-bye. Love you.
Claire,"I would love to, but I'm not feeling that great, so I'm probably just gonna go home and rest. Plus I've seen that movie."
Claire,"No, I never saw ""Gone with the wind,"" but I have two kids at sleepovers, and Haley's out of town with Phil. That means I have one night to myself, which happens once every never. I am not spending it with some gossipy mom who was mean to me in High School. I need a fun night out."
Claire,"What the hell is this? No. I asked you guys for a fun night out, not this. I-I-I need music and dancing and secondhand smoke."
Cameron,"Oh, please give this place a chance. It's a great value. The room is so cozy, and the potpies are to die for."
Claire,"Are you really comfortable with what you just said? Come on. What happened to the party people who took me to a rave, and I got to wear a tube top, and I stuffed cash in a caged go-go boy's speedo?"
Mitchell,We're still party people.
Cameron,"Oh, Joanne, before I forget, can I get a punch? One away from a free potpie."
Claire,"If that was your gay card, it would be revoked."
Mitchell,"Okay, you know what, Claire? You're being a little High School you."
Claire,"I am sorry, Mitchell, but I get one free night, and I can't spend it at a place that is a proud supporter of Wilson Elementary."
Cameron,"We all need to give back, Claire."
Claire,Give me back my night.
Mitchell,"Okay, well, Longinus did invite us to a boutique opening, you know, cocktails, DJ. But it'll... it'll be a whole scene, though."
Claire,A scene? A scene is perfect. That's great. I will get in the car before you guys change your mind. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Cameron,So does that mean no potpies?
Mitchell,"Uh, hey, Joanne? Two number nines to go."
Phil,Was I wrong? Are these not the best wings you've ever had in your life?
Haley,"Oh, my God."
Phil,"And you didn't wanna get 40. Oh, and by the way, this is just the start of your evening. Next up, it's over to the quad for a musical interlude from tenors, anyone? It's an all-male singing group..."
Haley,Got it.
Haley,"Yeah, I'm Haley, and this is my d..."
Phil,Big Brother. You bought it for a second. How are you?
Haley,"Oh! Uh, you know what? That's okay. My dad's got this whole thing planned... but thank you anyway."
Phil,"Nice meeting you. How fun is this? Just me and you. I was a little nervous you wouldn't see what's so special about this place. Not that I'm pushing you to come here. You know, you're... you're gonna make your own decisions. You wanna go with them, don't you?"
Haley,"No, we're doing our thing."
Phil,"Yeah, quick. Before they leave."
Haley,Are you sure?
Phil,Go. I can handle it. You're not the first girl to leave me at this table with a plateful of chicken wings. I'm kidding! I wish I was kidding. You weren't supposed to hear that. Have fun.
Haley,Okay. Love you.
Phil,Love you.
Claire,Nose job.
Claire,What do they do with all the butt they take out?
Cameron,Randolph?
Mitchell,Marcus?
Cameron,Lamichael?
Claire,Drama. Love it! This is what I wanted.
Mitchell,I could use a little seltzer water.
Claire,"Mm, I will be after I get a drink. See, that's what gay is supposed to be like."
Mitchell,"Okay, I don't know about you, but I got about five minutes of fabulous left in me."
Cameron,"Yeah, in my mind, I'm already in our kitchen. I'm watching my potpie rotate in the microwave."
Mitchell,Okay. Okay. When did hats come back?
Cameron,"That one's come back about eight times. Pick a side of the room, lady."
Claire,"All right, there's, like, a thousand people waiting for wine. I wanna try on a couple of dresses, and then Julian here's gonna take us to a club across town."
Cameron,I think we're gonna go home.
Claire,What? Why? It's 9:30.
Mitchell,It's 9:30?
Claire,"When did you two become such old women? First, you take me to that senior center for porridge, and now you can't even stay up past Luke's bedtime?"
Cameron,It's Friday. We get tired on Fridays.
Mitchell,We get very tired.
Claire,I have 3 children. I've been tired since 2005. Let's rally. You're my ride.
Claire,Really?
Claire,"Okay. All right, girls, go home, roll up your hair, clap out the lights, 'cause this guy, who I just met, is gonna show me a good time."
Mitchell,"Okay, well, if he was straight, this would be just like High School."
Jay,This is ridiculous. She's obviously got a pistol under that poncho. How do you watch this stuff?
Gloria,He's been up there for more than one hour. I can't stand this.
Jay,Who's been up there? Ronaldo's doing the dishes right in front of her.
Gloria,"Manny, in his bedroom."
Jay,"Gloria, are you even watching this? I'm doing this for you."
Gloria,What does he has in that box that he cannot show to me?
Jay,Little boys are supposed to keep secrets from their mothers. Wait. The judge just peeked through the window. Is he interested in Celia now? She could be his daughter.
Gloria,"I bet it's a birthday gift for me. Yeah, that sounds right."
Jay,What's he saying? I've never seen him this mad.
Gloria,Wait a minute. I already found my birthday gift underneath his bed. It's a giant hat. When did hats came back anyway?
Jay,"Now she's reaching under the poncho. Like she's gonna shoot Ronaldo. He's the main character, right?"
Gloria,That's it. I'm going up there.
Jay,"Wait, Gloria. No. Don't go."
Gloria,Why not?
Jay,"Think about it. 13-year-old boy, talks about girls all day long. We have more security on these computers than the Pentagon. What do you think he's doing up there... alone?"
Gloria,Do you think he ordered some movies?
Jay,"Movies, magazines, whatever the hell."
Gloria,"How dare do you say that, Jay?! He's a little boy! He's just a boy. I don't want to talk to you. I'm gonna take a walk."
Jay,"Gloria, come on. Come back. I know you're not mad at me. You just... Oh! What'd she do? Ronaldo!"
Phil,"Wang chung! Pay up, gentlemen! Yes! Thank you! Really? That's so nice. Another pitcher, my good woman."
Phil,"Claire would have killed me if she'd known that I let Haley go off alone while I chilled in a bar with some undergrads, but I happen to trust my daughter. Also, I was tracking her location with the GPS on her phone."
Phil,"Fellas, Cedar and Los Alamos. That's, uh..."
Phil,Pi Chi?
Mitchell,"Oh, come on. Why is my Bluetooth not working? Oh, God. It's Longinus. He's gonna be so mad at us."
Cameron,"Hey, Longe. Don't be mad at us for leaving."
Mitchell,"We're sorry, but the sitter called, and, uh, Lily was running a fever. So... we feel even worse about dumping Claire on you and your hot date."
Cameron,"Who is gorgeous, by the way. Seems super funny, too. Perfect for you."
Cameron,"What? Julian's straight. Oh, I love it when a straight person and a gay person go out together."
Mitchell,"Oh, my God. This isn't our car."
Cameron,What?
Mitchell,This isn't our Prius! They... they must've given us the wrong one at the valet. That's why the Bluetooth isn't working.
Cameron,We stole a car? Are you serious?
Cameron,"Oh, we stole a car. Uh, we gotta go."
Mitchell,"Okay, we did not steal a car, Cam. It was given to us."
Cameron,Why are you giving me attitude? You're the one that stole a car.
Mitchell,How is this a stolen car?! How?!
Cameron,I don't know! I'm confused! Do you have an aspirin?
Mitchell,This isn't my car!
Claire,"Hey, Lukie. Hi. What's going on? I'll check. I have it. Well, I could bring it by and meet you outside in 20 minutes? No, sw... out... out... Outside, sweetie. Okay. Bye-bye. Do you mind swinging by my kid's sleepover? I gotta give him this retainer. It's on the way to the club."
Claire,"You are so sweet. Holy pythons, Batman. Do you ever leave the gym?"
Claire,"Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to try out that second one. Zip, please."
Claire,I've got two kids at sleepovers and one upstate with daddy. The fun is just beginning.
Mitchell,"Unbelievable. The valet gave our car away to someone, like, and hour and a half ago."
Cameron,You know what that means. Our potpies could be anywhere by now.
Mitchell,"Y... they probably went home. If... if we knew their address, maybe we could see if our car was there."
Cameron,"Oh, yeah. And how do you propose we do that?"
Cameron,"Oh, you're good. Oh, and look. Only .6 miles away."
Mitchell,"Notice how she didn't wait until after the turn to tell me, Cam?"
Cameron,Really? This? Now?
Mitchell,I'm just...
Cameron,"Oh, look. They went to see Jay-Z. We almost went to see Jay-Z, didn't we?"
Mitchell,"No, no, no, 'cause remember it started at 8:30."
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, which meant he wouldn't have gone on until 10:00."
Mitchell,And then that parking nightmare.
Cameron,"Oh, and those stairs."
Mitchell,"Okay, I'm hearing it now. Is Claire right? Are we in a rut?"
Cameron,"Well, we might be, especially compared to these people. Look at this. Cancun luggage tickets. A parking pass to Yosemite. A triathlon bib. This is living."
Mitchell,"No, but you know what? We have Lily, okay? I know. You can't do that with a child."
Cameron,They have a car seat.
Mitchell,"Okay, fine, we're in a rut."
Mitchell,"You know, maybe we just need to be around more stimulating people."
Cameron,"Well, we're gonna be in about 900 feet."
Mitchell,It's not the craziest idea. They seem like fun people.
Cameron,"Yeah, and maybe we can be new couples friends with them. You know, we can go out to concerts, try exciting new food, maybe do some luxury camping."
Mitchell,"Yeah, hitch our wagon to their star and see how fast they spice up our life."
Cameron,I believe we have.
Mitchell,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God."
Cameron,What's happening?!
Mitchell,I'm trying! We are in a rut!
Cameron,Really? You wanna talk about that right now?
Mitchell,"No, we are stuck! We're in an actual rut. We're stuck."
Cameron,Ohh!
Mitchell,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God!"
Cameron,We are victims of a hate crime right now!
Cameron,"Go! Go! Oh, my God"
Phil,"Oh, no, you don't."
Haley,"Dad, what are you doing here?"
Phil,"What's this, buddy."
Phil,"Oh, really? 'Cause is smells... Okay, it smells like ginger ale. But that doesn't prove anything."
Haley,What the hell?
Phil,We are leaving.
Haley,I'm having a nice time with...
Phil,"With this clown? And by the way, it's a little cliche to pick someone who looks exactly like your dad. I got your number, Pi Chi. I know you."
Haley,"Yeah, you do. This is Ben Ford. He's in my class. He's visiting, too."
Haley,What is wrong with you? Are you trying to ruin college for me before I even get here?
Phil,"No, I-I'm not. I am so sorry. You are not a clown. You were an excellent backup shortstop. Alecia. Bruce. Go, bullfrogs... Dogs! Go, bulldogs. Claire!"
Jay,"Wow. Really? No, it's just a shock, is all."
Gloria,Jay?
Jay,So Celia's carrying the judge's baby. No wonder she shot him. She's hormonal.
Gloria,Who are you talking to?
Jay,"The housekeeper. Maria, I've gotta go. Thanks a lot."
Gloria,"Jay, I need you to talk to Manny."
Jay,What?
Gloria,"Well, if he's doing what you think he's doing, then he needs to talk to a man. I don't want him to be ashamed of anything."
Jay,Then you don't want to send me in there.
Gloria,"Yeah, but what if... if he has questions? What if he doesn't know how to..."
Jay,"Gloria, Gloria, whatever he's going through, he can work it out himself."
Manny,Help! I'm stuck!
Gloria,"Ay, no, Jay, go. I beg of you! Go! Go! Go!"
Jay,Gloria. I'm extremely reluctant to do this.
Manny,Please hurry!
Gloria,"Ay, no. I cannot look at this."
Jay,What the hell?
Manny,"I can't get down, Jay."
Gloria,"What? What happened to Manny?! Ay, somebody say something to me!"
Jay,"Gloria, it's okay. Come on in."
Gloria,Okay.
Jay,He was hanging from that bar up there.
Gloria,What? Why? What do you have on your head?
Manny,It's a weighted helmet to stretch me so I can get taller.
Gloria,Manny! Why do you have to get tall now?
Manny,"Love, mom. Why else? I lost Bella to Durkus because, in her words, ""he's tall."" Everybody else is getting taller but me. You think it's the coffee?"
Gloria,No. Maybe. But... but hanging downside up is not gonna help you.
Manny,The web site said it would.
Gloria,"Listen, Manny, you're already intelligent and beautiful and funny. If you get tall, you're going to have everything, and those poor boys are not gonna have anything to compete with you. Look at this. You have a mark on your head now. I'm gonna go get you some ice, okay?"
Manny,"That's a lot of pretty words, but they don't help me tomorrow."
Jay,"Sorry, kid. It's just one of those things. You get taller when you get taller. Why don't you get ready for bed? Ah, jeez. You know, when I was your age, I started working out to get the girls."
Manny,You think that would help?
Jay,"Yeah. So tomorrow, we start working out. Okay? Maybe I'll even show you a few pull-ups on, uh, this bad boy here, huh? You see that? Pretty soon, that's how strong... you're gonna be."
Luke,"Thanks, mom."
Claire,I don't want them to know I was here.
Luke,Okay.
Claire,"I can't. 'Cause I'm sick, remember? Sorry."
Claire,"I could, but I don't want to ruin it for you."
Claire,"Um... Scarlett is... really mad at Clark Gable because, um, he says so many bad things. And didn't he, um, burn down a farm or something?"
Claire,I had a hot toddy. Made one for my throat.
Claire,"Yeah, I-I just threw on the first thing I could find... when Luke called, and it was just right there on the chair."
Claire,"Okay. All right. Before we bust out the pitchforks and the torches, may I remind you that I've driven every one of your children home and Heimliched at least one, Bethenny."
Claire,I... friend. Gay friend. Gay.
Claire,"Yes, you are."
Claire,Are you serious right now?
Claire,"No, no. No, I have not."
Claire,"Bethenny, do not grab the Pinot."
Claire,That was... that was me safely objectifying a gay person.
Claire,"Oh, ease up, Holly. Okay, I lied. I lied, but I get one night to myself, and I just wanted to spend it with some fun gay people. It's not my fault this one decided to be straight."
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,"Please? Please, just listen to me for one second."
Haley,Go away! Stop following me!
Phil,"Oh, no, no, no, no. Officer, this is my daughter. Tell him."
Haley,"Tonight, I don't know who you are."
Phil,"She's... she's joking. I'm not dangerous. In fact, I-I-I helped to put all the lights on this path. 20 years ago, some friends and I took back the night. So... I- I think I just... I embarrassed her a little."
Haley,"""A little""? That sweatshirt embarrasses me ""a little."""
Haley,Tonight was insane. Why did you have to act like that?
Phil,"You were at that party. I see you talking to frat boys, and..."
Haley,"Isn't that why we're here, so I can experience college? I mean, what are you gonna do when I actually go?"
Phil,"I don't know. Freak out, I think. Look... your whole life, my job has been to protect you... a job I kinda love. Now I feel like I'm being forced into early retirement. I just needed to find you and make sure you were okay... for as long as I still get to do that."
Haley,Just like you... piss me off and then say something sweet. I'm not leaving until the fall.
Phil,Maybe by then I can figure out how to put a force field around you. I've been working on that one since the first time I tried to fasten you into your car seat. I pinched your chunky little thigh.
Haley,You know you basically just called me fat. So... is it really fun?
Phil,What? No!
Jay,We all struggle with limitations... Some we're willing to accept...
Cameron,"You know, I just wanna be home, reading on opposite ends of the sofa."
Jay,And some we're not.
Manny,I'm so embarrassed I did that.
Gloria,I'm just so happy that that was all it was.
Manny,Why? What'd you think I was doing?
Jay,It's never too late to grow in life.
Haley,"Oh, my God!"
Jay,"""Thanks to our patented lengthenator, you can increase your height by up to 4 inches."""
Gloria,I can't believe he would spend $50 on this thing.
Jay,"I know. He could've got a 2-year subscription to ""Playboy"" for that."
Gloria,"He's not getting the ""Playboy"" ever! He's a little boy!"
Cameron,Wouldn't it be great if we woke up tomorrow and our car had found its way home?
Mitchell,"Yeah, I feel that's not the way it's gonna happen."
Cameron,"Happened on the farm one time. A tornado scooped up one of our calves, dropped it who knows where. Six months later, a full-grown cow comes walking up the driveway... same markings, same moo. That night, we..."
Mitchell,We ate like kings.
Cameron,"Okay, I've told it before. Oh, my gosh! It's our car!"
Claire,Honey! What is all this?
Phil,Hey!
Haley,Hey mom! I'm trying to write a stupid college essay question and I really don't even know where to start.
Claire,"OK, what's the question? Tell me."
Haley,"""What's the biggest obstacle you ever had to overcome?"" Didn't my 3rd Grade teacher said I had like ADD or something?"
Claire,"Oh, no honey. She said you couldn't ADD. She put it that way because she also knew you couldn't S-P-E-O-L."
Haley,"Wait, slow down."
Claire,Sweetheart. What's this?
Phil,"We talked about this last week. I said I'm building Luke a treehouse, you said fine. You know? Sometimes I think you just turn me out."
Phil,"I never told her. She just would have said ""no."""
Claire,"I don't remember agreeing to this, Phil. This is like the time you backed down the driveway with a hang glider sticking out of the car."
Phil,"If you'd let me keep that, those geese would have followed me to the wetlands."
Claire,You would have died.
Phil,A hero.
Gloria,Why? Why we never have the picnic?
Jay,Who wants to sit on a blanket? There's no back support.
Gloria,It's majestic.
Gloria,"Jay hates the crowds, the beach, the rainbows."
Jay,Rainbows? It's just colors in the sky. Do we have to pull over every time and take a picture? Shame.
Gloria,Jay also hates running.
Mitchell,"Oh, thank you."
Cameron,Oh. What is this?
Cameron,"Oh, well, look. It's already working!"
Mitchell,"Cam, down. Down."
Cameron,"Oh, okay, maybe... maybe later. Did you hear that? Waitress is flirting with me."
Mitchell,"No, no. She's not flirting with you. She's... she's trolling for tips, okay? She totally knows you're gay."
Cameron,How would she know I'm gay?
Mitchell,"Uh, maybe it's the way you ordered a drink-a-doodle-doo."
Mitchell,Cam has this crazy theory that if he were straight... And Julia Roberts were single... They'd be dating.
Cameron,"It's not crazy. I met her once at an A.I.D.S. walk, and our chemistry was palpable."
Mitchell,"No, you handed her a bottle of water."
Cameron,And her fingers lingered.
Mitchell,Because you wouldn't let go.
Cameron,"I could totally pick up any woman in here. Crispin If by that, you mean lift her off the ground, then yes, I'll give you that."
Mitchell,Or you could be someone who just stepped out of a machine called the womanizer.
Cameron,"Okay, you know what? That's it. Pick anyone in here. If I can get their number, you do the laundry for a month. If I fail, I'll do it."
Mitchell,"Okay. I hate doing laundry. So, um... No, um... Oh, okay. Right here. Her."
Cameron,"Okay, great. Great. Just get rid of my flair... Crispin Whoa. Where did Cam go?"
Mitchell,I don't know. Where is he?
Gloria,"It sounds like so much fun. I love salsa dancing. Jay, let's go salsa dancing with them. Look. Why not?"
Jay,I just bought that pay-per-view fight. I tell you what... we'll compromise. We'll watch the fight. We'll eat salsa.
Gloria,"Ay, no, I wouldn't want to..."
Jay,All I hear is she could use a break.
Cameron,"Hey! Oh, my God! How are you?"
Cameron,Wow. Look at you. You look fantastic.
Cameron,How long has it been?
Cameron,Yeah.
Cameron,"Oh, let's see. I think it was at Dave's thing."
Cameron,"Oh, my God. I am so sorry. It was just a clever way to try to approach you. We don't know each other."
Cameron,"Oh, my God! That was genius! And mean! Now I know why we're old fake friends. Oh. Can I buy you a drink?"
Cameron,Cameron.
Cameron,"If she were a hot guy, I would never have been that smooth. It's ironic. Like the gift of the vagi."
Cameron,Thank you. Nice to meet you.
Cameron,"Bye! Wham, bam, thank you, Cam."
Mitchell,Seriously? You got her number?
Cameron,"Sure did. And all my shirts get ironed, and their seams should appear straight, just like their owner."
Luke,Should you be using screws instead of nails?
Phil,"America was built with nails, son."
Luke,So was that gazebo you built for our 4th of July party.
Phil,"I'm telling you, you are gonna love this bad boy. You know what can't climb trees?"
Luke,Raccoons?
Phil,"Worries. Raccoons can and will get up here, so don't leave any food, or they'll get territorial and attack."
Luke,Are you sure this is a good idea?
Phil,"Are you kidding me? You're gonna have so much fun hanging out up here with your buddies. Trust me, when you get older, it all changes."
Luke,Why?
Phil,"Well, life gets in the way. Did I just say ""wife gets in the way""? 'Cause sometimes I do that."
Luke,"Nope, you're good. And you have lots of friends."
Phil,"Yeah, I have work friends, and your mom and I have couples friends, and there are my college friends, but they're scattered all over the country. It's not the same as just shouting out to your neighborhood buddies, ""Hey, fellas! I'm up here in the tree house!"" Uhh! I got to fix that... board."
Haley,I can't do this.
Claire,Why are you so frustrated?
Haley,Because I've never had any obstacles to overcome.
Claire,"Oh, honey, that's not true."
Haley,Really? Name one.
Claire,Well... You're lactose-intolerant.
Haley,"Oh, ""dear college, cheese makes me gassy. See you in September."""
Claire,"Sweetie, you're not really starting your essays ""dear college,"" are you?"
Haley,"What difference does it make? I've lived a boring, sheltered, pathetic life."
Claire,I am sorry we have made things too easy and comfortable for you.
Haley,"Oh, you should be! It is all your fault! You have shielded me from everything interesting and dangerous!"
Claire,You are blaming me because I kept you from getting hurt?
Haley,Gaby's mom's a hoarder. That essay practically writes itself.
Claire,Maybe it is our fault. But did you ever consider there's a reason?
Haley,What are you talking about?
Claire,There's a reason why we were so easy on you.
Haley,I don't understand.
Claire,"Oh, honey, you're old enough now."
Haley,Old enough for what?
Claire,"The truth. Okay, come on. Gotta show you somethin'. We're gonna go for a ride."
Haley,"Mom, just tell me."
Claire,"You are my mom, right?"
Mitchell,"Oh, hey."
Cameron,I'm a bad man.
Mitchell,"Oh, no. What did you eat?"
Cameron,"Mitchell, remember the girl I met last night?"
Mitchell,How can I forget her? She's super famous for having the world's worst gay-dar.
Cameron,"How could I be so cavalier with her emotions? You know, we had a real connection. She gave me her number, and right now she's probably sitting by the phone waiting for me to call. I don't think you understand how charmed she was by me."
Mitchell,"Oh, my God. Where did you get all this self-confidence?"
Cameron,I won cutest baby at the 1974 Jasper county fair. People at the time said I could go gerber. You know what? I'm calling her.
Mitchell,What?
Cameron,"No, I can't carry this around. I have to come clean so she can move on with her life."
Mitchell,This is crazy. She is not waiting...
Cameron,"Hi. Katie. It's Cam. First ring. I was hoping I would call, too."
Mitchell,"Oh, smooth."
Cameron,"So listen, I forgot to mention something last night, and I'm... I'm actually not really quite sure how to say this."
Mitchell,I'm a gay guy.
Cameron,"Um, it's actually somewhat delicate."
Mitchell,"As am I, on account of the gay."
Cameron,"No, no, I had a great time with you, too, Katie. It's... well, it's just that..."
Mitchell,I don't dig the ladies.
Cameron,"No, no. And I want you to sit... I want you to have a seat on a chaise lounge."
Jay,"Hey, you wanna go out and grab some dinner before the fight tonight?"
Gloria,"No, thank you."
Jay,"Wanna eat at home? I'll grill some steaks, open a bottle of wine."
Gloria,"Whatever you want, because I'm not going to be here."
Manny,She's going salsa dancing without me.
Gloria,"Ay, Manny, I told you, it's a 21 and over club."
Manny,A forbidden dance floor. Only makes me want it more.
Jay,Wait a second. You're going dancing with Shorty and Darlene?
Gloria,"Yes, because even though he's old like you, he still likes to have fun."
Jay,"We like to have fun. Last week I took you to dinner, went to the boat show, got some sherbet?"
Gloria,And we were home by 8:30 with no boat.
Jay,What do you want from me? I don't like dancing.
Gloria,I don't like sherbet.
Jay,"Yeah, right. How about coconut?"
Gloria,"Who doesn't like the coconut, hmm? Who? And anyways, I'm going dancing with or without you."
Jay,Fine. I hope you have a good time with Shorty.
Gloria,I don't need Shorty! I won't have any problem finding a partner on my own!
Manny,"Wow. Way to rub it in, mom."
Mitchell,"How'd it go, heartbreaker?"
Cameron,That is one classy lady... which is why I couldn't tell her.
Mitchell,What?
Cameron,"Well... I just couldn't do it on the phone. She seemed so excited to hear from me, and I'm very bad at disappointing people, Mitchell."
Mitchell,Not all people.
Cameron,"Mama was right when she said my charm was like a wild stallion... if not properly bridled, it'll bust down a barn."
Mitchell,"Okay, you wanna get rid of your girlfriend? Tell her that story."
Cameron,Maybe I will when she comes over. She's coming over.
Mitchell,Are you serious?
Cameron,"She said she was in the area running errands. What was I supposed to say, ""don't come over""? Well, I guess I could have said that, but it's too late now, plus I wanna break it to her gently. So come on. Help me un-gay this place."
Mitchell,You know what? I'll make it less gay by half.
Cameron,"Oh, these flowers should go, too."
Mitchell,You mean the ones underneath the portrait of you cuddling another man?
Cameron,"Oh, good catch. Aw."
Jay,Manny.
Manny,"What's up, big guy?"
Jay,How hard is it to learn this salsa dancing stuff?
Manny,"Not hard at all. It's about tapping into your emotion, your passion, and your inner fire."
Jay,Crap!
Jay,"I stink at dancing. First dance at our wedding, Gloria was all graceful and gorgeous, and I was all big and clunky. Like that scene from ""Beauty and the beast."" Actually, that was the song. Manny picked it. He didn't like me back then."
Manny,"Back straight. Okay. Do as I do. Other leg. Okay, stop marching. You're dancing, not invading Poland."
Mitchell,"Hello, hi! I'm looking for Jay Pritchett. He's about 6'2"", tough guy, wrestles with homophobia..."
Jay,The hell are you doing here?
Mitchell,"Uh, I had to get out of the house. Cam needed a little alone time with his new girlfriend. Don't ask."
Jay,Don't tell.
Mitchell,What's going on here?
Manny,"He's learning to dance, but he's just so tense."
Jay,It's not working out.
Manny,'Cause you're not letting go.
Jay,"I'm trying. Don't you think I want to be all smooth and make your mom happy out there? But I just can't do it, that's all."
Manny,"Jay, I'm not giving up on you."
Mitchell,"Okay. Hey, Manny, would you give us a second? Thanks. Dad, look, I-I know this is weird, but you and I are a lot alike. We're self-conscious, okay? So, um, here. Just..."
Jay,The hell is this?
Mitchell,"It's just something that some people take at clubs to, you know, loosen up."
Jay,You take this?
Mitchell,"A gay man who hates dancing lives in a sad and lonely little world. This just melts your inhibitions, and... and you can dance all night, plus it gives you a raging..."
Jay,I don't wanna... I don't like this at all.
Mitchell,Just hold on to it. Just in case. Come on. It's fine.
Manny,"Jay, I wanna show you something. A farmer in New Zealand taught a pig to dance."
Mitchell,Oh.
Manny,See how he keeps his snout up?
Claire,Yep. This is it.
Haley,This is what?
Claire,This. I-I can't do this. I can't get out of the car. I'm sorry. I'm too embarrassed.
Haley,Would you just tell me what's going on?
Claire,Okay. I-I want you to go read what's carved in that tree.
Haley,"Mom, you're freaking me out."
Claire,"Just do it. Do it, Haley. Have fun getting home! There's your obstacle!"
Haley,What?! Are you kidding me?!
Phil,Oh! Son of a... Brisket! Why does that keep happening? Maybe I need a nail gun.
Luke,"Okay, that's it! I'm out!"
Phil,"What do you mean, you're out? Where are you going?"
Luke,"Dad, no offense, but I've seen you with a glue gun. I think a nail is gonna be harder to get out of my hair."
Phil,"No, don't go! I'm doing this for you!"
Luke,"Are you, dad? Are you?"
Phil,The kid made me think with that one. Who was I really doing this for?
Luke,"Sometimes I just say, ""are you, dad? Are you?"" Because he gets real quiet and doesn't notice when I walk away."
Cameron,"Katie, you're an amazing woman. You're smart, you're beautiful, and how fun is that handbag? This is gonna come as a little bit of a shock. I'm fairly gay. I don't know why I said that. I'm... I'm totally gay. Just gay."
Cameron,Yeah.
Cameron,"I was born that way. I mean, you know, it's just..."
Cameron,"Well, it's not that... it's not that obvious."
Cameron,"I do not have theatrical hand gestures. Okay, maybe I am moderately... expressive. But why would you give me your number?"
Cameron,Those are totally offensive stereotypes.
Cameron,"I know her, and she's as nice as she seems on screen."
Cameron,"She is, yeah."
Cameron,"I was just a stupid bar bet. My boyfriend... oh, he's here... bet me that I couldn't get a beautiful woman's number. And as a proud gay man, I know it shouldn't matter, but I-I just wish everyone could find me attractive. Oh. But now he's gonna get to gloat, and I guess I deserve it."
Mitchell,Hi... hi. How's... how's it going? Hello.
Cameron,"This is Katie, and, uh, it turns out, well..."
Mitchell,Wow.
Cameron,No.
Mitchell,Cam.
Cameron,"Yes. Yes. Look... You're gonna find somebody, because you're an amazing girl, Katie. You're the whole package. I just prefer somebody who has one."
Mitchell,Oh... my... God!
Cameron,That was a lot of girl tongue! I think I need a drink-a-doodle-doo.
Haley,What was that?
Claire,"Hello, Haley. How was your day?"
Haley,"I have no money, no cell phone..."
Claire,You're welcome.
Haley,What?!
Claire,"I listened to you. I stopped coddling you, and look... you overcame an obstacle."
Haley,Oh! Yeah! I did! I grew up normal despite my crazy mom!
Claire,"Well, that sounds like the beginning of a great essay. ""Dear college..."" Oh, honey, if you get stuck, let me know, and I'll make you sleep out in the yard."
Haley,You're psychotic!
Claire,Use spell check!
Gloria,"I'm good, I'm good."
Gloria,We don't know each other. Go away.
Gloria,"Aw, you know, salsa is so intimate and sensual that it feels wrong to do it with somebody else that is not Jay."
Gloria,"You know, I think I should go home to my loving husband and pull him close and tell him that I danced with 20 men."
Jay,He's not home. He's in a dicey neighborhood worried about his car.
Gloria,Yay! Hey! Jay!
Jay,"What, are we gonna kiss or dance?"
Gloria,Let's dance!
Jay,"I'm dead set against drugs. ""Just say no"" and all that stuff. But I thought, just this once for Gloria. And if I was gonna make a complete ass of myself, I didn't wanna remember it."
Mitchell,The big drug I gave him... baby aspirin. Orange-flavored. He could have chewed it.
Phil,"Oh, thanks. I'm trying. It's for my son, but he's kind of lost interest."
Phil,Did you just move in?
Phil,12.
Phil,Huh.
Phil,"Me, too."
Phil,"Yes, a lot. But I-I don't wanna bother you."
Phil,"Do you even have a level? I did, but I might have gotten frustrated and thrown it into your yard."
Phil,"Thanks. I'm Phil, by the way."
Phil,"Nice to meet you, Andre."
Phil,"So I guess I was wrong when I said once you get older, it's harder to make new friends."
Phil,"Andre, it turns out, is an orthopedic surgeon, handy with tools, and a great guy to hang out with. Plus he's a badass black man that gives me extra street cred. That's his joke. He's my brotha from a different motha."
Phil,Different...
Phil,What is it?
Phil,Brotha from anotha motha...
Phil,Brotha from another motha.
Claire,"Oh, thank you so much for the donations."
Claire,"Oh, I'm sure it's great."
Claire,"Three weeks ago, our neighbours the Rands lost their house and everything they owned in a fire. Fortunately, nobody was hurt."
Phil,"And fortunately, they're friends with wonder woman over here."
Claire,I'm hardly wonder woman.
Phil,"She mobilized the community to donate clothes, furniture, appliances, all to help them start over in their new rental."
Claire,Which you found them.
Phil,I'm no Wonder Woman. Rand-aid was her idea.
Claire,"It wasn't my idea to call it ""Rand-aid."""
Phil,"Okay, fine. I'm Wonder Woman."
Jay,Terrible tragedy.
Gloria,They're our closest friends.
Jay,"We know them. Uh, Manny and their son Reuben are tight. In fact, I put in one of their closets. Not that it matters, but it was the only structure to survive the fire."
Gloria,"Por favor, don't even say that word! In my country it is considered very, very bad luck when your house burns down."
Mitchell,They lived a block away from us.
Cameron,"Smoke was everywhere. I was so upset, I couldn't sleep for days. Of course, Mitchell won't let me take anything."
Mitchell,"Well, Cam, we both know why. Some people have been known to sleepwalk or even sleep drive on that medication. Cam's reaction is much worse."
Mitchell,"Oh! Ohh! Oh, God."
Cameron,I sleep clown.
Claire,"Dad, you're gonna kill yourself."
Jay,I got it! We're on a schedule here. I still have to pick up the truck.
Gloria,"If you want him to stop lifting things, put all this in grocery bags and turn the TV on to a football game."
Phil,Oh! Take this phone away from me!
Claire,Why?
Phil,"Two of our best brokers left to start their own agency, and the office gossip is flying. But I want today to be about the Rands... And if I have this... Oh, my God! Those guys took two secretaries and the tube dude with them!"
Gloria,Who's the tube dude?
Phil,"You know, the blowy guy that attracts all the attention. This guy..."
Gloria,"Ah, si, I've seen him. He goes down over there, and then he shakes up. And goes down in there, and then..."
Phil,You almost got it.
Gloria,And then goes down.
Mitchell,"Hi, hi, sorry. We would have been here sooner, but this one had a wardrobe crisis."
Cameron,"You know, it's a somber occasion, and all my tops are too joyful."
Mitchell,You do not want our problems.
Cameron,"No. Oh, here, Jay, let me help."
Jay,"No, I got it. Aah! My back!"
Claire,Dad!
Phil,"No, Jay, that's not quite it. Remember, you got air blowing through you, so it's more like... And then out. And then out."
Jay,Leave me alone. I'm fine. I've gotta pick up that truck.
Cameron,I'd be happy to get the truck.
Jay,I don't think so. It's a pretty big truck.
Cameron,Oh. Is it... is it bigger than the combine I've been driving since I was 12 years old? Or the Windrow tractor with the Macdon header that I drove to and parallel parked at my High School prom? Hmm?
Mitchell,At least something got plowed that night.
Cameron,Heard that!
Jay,"Oh, son of bitch!"
Phil,"Your low back is in spasm, Jay. I can massage that out for you."
Jay,I'm fine.
Claire,"Dad, you don't know what you're missing. Phil is a magician."
Phil,"And a licensed masseur. Before I heard the siren song of residential real estate, I was bitten by the rub bug."
Mitchell,"No, he's... he's amazing. I had this knot in my leg, two minutes with Phil and it was gone."
Jay,"I'm sorry, but I think you might have a higher tolerance for a man's hands on your body than I do."
Mitchell,Charming.
Gloria,"Ay, don't be an idiot. Let Phil help you."
Jay,Fine.
Phil,Great! I'll just go get the room ready. I'll think you'll be surprised with what these hands can do.
Cameron,Really? Can they drive a bobcat skid-steer with a bucket grapple through a school hallway on a dare? Because these can and have.
Manny,"Poor Reuben, huh? Having to rebuild his whole life at age 12."
Luke,Yeah. That blows.
Manny,"I know we're both shaken up, but let's watch the language."
Gloria,"Okay, put this in a safe place. It's for Reuben. It's one of those, um, how do you say again, the takka-takka-takka..."
Luke,Is that the helicopter with the camera in it...
Manny,Mm-hmm.
Luke,That you control with your phone? The one I asked for?
Gloria,"Okay, when your house burns down, you get one of these. Now don't burn your house down."
Luke,How lucky is Reuben?
Manny,So lucky.
Luke,You know what? I say we take this thing out and see how she flies.
Manny,I don't know. My mom got it for Reuben.
Luke,"Oh, so now he won't even share his toys?"
Manny,He never does.
Luke,Screw that guy!
Manny,Yaeh! You're a terrible influence.
Luke,You need me.
Gloria,"Claire, in case you want to add something, I put the box of dresses outside and this is the box of snicker snackers."
Claire,"Mm. Thanks. Mitchell, we did have something to add to this box of, um... Snicker snackers. What?"
Mitchell,English is not her first language. She's just trying to help.
Claire,"Mitchell, come on. You can't do that. You can't just change the rules. This is what we do. When Gloria says something silly, we innocently laugh behind her back."
Mitchell,"She's had a rough week, all right? She's really worried about tia Maria Cecilia and that surgery. Oh, and then she lost her cell phone at pilates."
Claire,How do you know this?
Mitchell,We have coffee.
Claire,"Oh. Have? So when did this become, like, a thing?"
Mitchell,What's the big deal? We're friends. I like Gloria.
Claire,"Uh, it's no big deal. I have nothing against her, I just think... Oh! Mm. All right. So before you get all judge-y, I gave her that vase."
Mitchell,After I gave it to you.
Haley,You couldn't part with that T-shirt?
Alex,I love this shirt.
Haley,"You know, you don't have to look the way you look. Amber rand lost all her clothes in a fire, but she gets to build herself a new wardrobe."
Haley,Let me burn your clothes.
Claire,"Girls, get down here. There's a lot of work to do."
Alex,Ugh. She's in a mood.
Haley,"You know what we have to do, right?"
Alex,There's no way you're my real sister!
Haley,I hate you!
Alex,I can't believe you would ever... you're the most selfish...
Claire,"Okay, That's it! I cannot take the fighting! Just get out of the house."
Haley,Works every time.
Cameron,"You know, I don't even wanna drive the truck anymore even though on the farm I was..."
Jay,I can't take another farm story.
Cameron,Yay!
Jay,"You might wanna take someone with you. The thing's been parked there six months. You're gonna want to hose it down, sweep for spiders."
Claire,"Good news, girls. You're going with Uncle Cam."
Cameron,Yay!
Jay,"The pain must have been pretty bad if I was asking Phil for help. His need for my approval is exhausting. In ten years, I've asked him for one thing... to hook up my wireless printer. He still won't shut up about it."
Phil,"How's that printer working out for you? Still loving that printer, eh? You know, if your printer breaks from here, I can fix it on my phone."
Jay,Can you?
Phil,"I can, but I don't need to, because I fixed it forever."
Jay,"Just once, I wish he wouldn't make such a big deal about everything."
Phil,Okay. Now just disrobe and place the towel over your buttocks.
Cameron,Riding the open road in a big rig like this sure can work up a man's powerful appetite.
Alex,We've gone five blocks.
Cameron,Do you want a burger or not?
Haley,"I could eat. Hey, Alex, maybe Uncle Cam will let you borrow his hat later. You know, since you dress like a dude."
Alex,I like the way I dress.
Haley,"Uncle Cam, as her future prom date, will you please talk to her? You know fashion."
Cameron,"First of all, you're each beautiful in your own way, but you're both playing for second, because I'm too sexy for... this truck."
Alex,"I have to say, you do drive it surprisingly well."
Haley,"Yeah, who would have thought?"
Cameron,"Surprising? What, that... that a gay man can drive a truck? You know, I expect that kind of thinking from Jay's generation. But from our future generation? No."
Cameron,Wow. This place got crowded.
Haley,Whoa. You're really wedged in there.
Alex,You want us to help guide you out?
Cameron,That question... it was like a hate crime.
Cameron,Sorry!
Haley,"Hey, you're really close on this side."
Cameron,"Yeah, I see it."
Haley,Careful!
Cameron,"I'm being careful. Gasping? Really? Holding hands? We're not in a nosedive. Okay, you know what, if it would make you feel better, get out and guide me. Okay, come on. Let's go."
Haley,"Please don't yell at me, but there's not enough room."
Cameron,"Okay, climb over. You're fine."
Phil,"You know, the native Americans believe that burning sage kept bad energy away."
Jay,How'd that work out for 'em? Get to the back.
Phil,That's the spirit. Thank you. I just need to make sure that the oil is a perfect 98.6. And it is perfect. Now I want you to take a deep breath and let me transport you to a land I call relaxistan.
Jay,"Oh, what the hell? Get off me. I knew this was a terrible... Oh, mama Lucian, that's good."
Luke,So you wanna try it?
Manny,I don't know. I'm still feeling guilty.
Luke,It's Reuben's helicopter. Reuben is the whole reason we should be doing this. He's barely living proof that life can change in a second. You gotta grab what you can when you can.
Manny,What is this hold you have on me? Wow.
Luke,"Okay, now ease up."
Manny,"Okay, I'm easing up. Okay, it's not working."
Luke,"Get ahold of yourself, Manny! She's getting away!"
Manny,I can't... I... I can't hold her!
Luke,"Give it to me! Mayday! Mayday! Oh, well."
Manny,"What do you mean ""oh, well""? My mom's gonna kill us."
Luke,Us? You were flying it. I was in the attic packing boxes.
Manny,"You're gonna help me find it, or the next search will be for you."
Luke,I like this guy. Where's he been?
Phil,Just relax. Let me know if I'm hurting you.
Jay,Are you kidding me? It's fantastic. I love you. This! I love this!
Jay,It just slipped out. Those are the worst three words I could say to Phil. I was just praying he would let it go and not make a big deal about it.
Phil,"Oh, my God. This is huge. Jay, I'm sorry. I need a minute."
Jay,Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch.
Mitchell,"Oh, these are fantastic. Why is Manny getting rid of them?"
Gloria,He said that they were last season.
Mitchell,I used to have a pair like these. I can never find 'em anymore.
Gloria,"Oh, there's an outlet store. They don't have men's size, but I'm sure the biggest size for boys would fit you perfectly. I'll take you."
Mitchell,All right. It's a date.
Claire,Oh. Another date.
Gloria,"Claire, I heard what happened with the vase, but I don't want you to worry about it."
Claire,": I'm so sorry. I should have told you about that sooner. It just... I have really been shaken by this whole fire thing. You know, life is so fragile."
Gloria,"I know, like a vase."
Claire,You tattled on me?
Mitchell,She asked me about it. What was I supposed to do? Why are you making those cruel sounds with your mouth?
Claire,You don't see it? You're turning Gloria into mom.
Mitchell,What?
Claire,"Mm-hmm. First you got all defensive of her, and then you tattled on me to her. That's exactly what you did with old mom. It's what you're doing with new mom."
Mitchell,"Okay, okay."
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Mitchell,Only you could make my friendship with Gloria into something ugly.
Claire,Don't get me wrong. I think it's sweet. We've all got our thing. You have mommy issues.
Mitchell,I do not have mommy issues!
Gloria,"Okay. So I pick you up tomorrow, we go get you your big boy pants, and then we go and get a little ice cream, okay?"
Claire,Perfect.
Gloria,Hi. You still don't feel very good?
Jay,I told Phil I loved him. Oh. It was an accident. You know how he gets with that stuff.
Gloria,"Ay, I know."
Phil,"Jay, can I talk to you later about what just happened?"
Jay,Yeah.
Phil,"Thanks. Jeez, I just worked that out."
Gloria,You're screwed.
Phil,Today is the biggest day of my life. Just relax. Let me know if I'm hurting you.
Jay,Are you kidding me? It's fantastic. I love you. This! I love this!
Phil,"Oh, my God. This is huge. Jay, I'm sorry. I need a minute."
Phil,"The two guys who left the firm asked me to quit my job and partner with them at the new agency. Big opportunity, big risk, and they need an answer by the end of the day. I don't always make great decisions under pressure."
Claire,What the hell is that?
Phil,An alpaca. I got the last one.
Cameron,I hate you!
Haley,"Okay, so... I flirted with a table of truckers who have offered to help us."
Cameron,No! No help! I've come too far!
Alex,Have you?
Cameron,"Oh, hey! They don't sell pizzas at this restaurant! You parked here illegally! Congratulations, sir. You're destroying America. Haley ; Hey, there are no cars behind us. Go!"
Alex,Gun it! Oh! Ow!
Cameron,All right! All right! Everybody relax! We're fine! We're fine!
Haley,We are not fine!
Alex,And we're all smooshed!
Haley,And we're scared!
Alex,And we're tilted at a 30-degree angle!
Haley,Nerd! And we're dirty and tired and late!
Cameron,Okay! Can you please just be quiet!
Haley,Why couldn't we have just asked for help?
Cameron,'Cause I'm teaching you girls a very valuable lesson... that gay men can do anything straight men can do.
Haley,"Yeah, we know that. Do you think you're the only gay guy that we know?"
Alex,Yeah. My soccer coach is gay...
Haley,Our pediatrician...
Alex,My Latin tutor.
Haley,Nerd! Our electrician.
Cameron,"Well, then why were you so surprised when I said I could drive a truck?"
Haley,"Not because you're gay, because you're you."
Alex,"And by the way, you can't."
Cameron,"Okay, wow. I guess I owe you an apology. I made a leap there. I'm just used to dealing with stereotypes. I'm a little sensitive about it."
Haley,"Oh! There's the trucker that I talked to. Hey! Excuse me! Hi! Could you give us a hand, please?"
Cameron,"Oh, like she'll be able to help us."
Claire,"Boy, do you have the right idea. Could use a little break from the mother and child reunion going on down there. Don't ask. Mitchell's turning Gloria into mom. Bam! It's out. Hmm. You remember the way mom and Mitchell used to be in their private little club, just the two of them, and no one else allowed in. Well... it's happening again, but this time around, it's happening with your wife. You should see them down there. It would actually be adorable if it weren't so sick. I just... you know, I feel like Mitchell is a grown man, he has a child, and he's still working out some psychodrama from 20 years ago. Daddy, can I have a sip of your beer, please? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Mitchell cozies up to mom, I go running to daddy. I'm the one who's turning Gloria into mom, which is really disturbing since we're the same age."
Jay,You're older.
Claire,"Oh. Oh, that's where we're gonna chime in?"
Luke,Will you hurry up?
Manny,"I'm saving my strength because if we don't find this helicopter, I'm walking to Canada."
Luke,Hope you like taxes.
Manny,Hey! That's our helicopter!
Luke,Just give it back. It's ours.
Manny,You guys are bullies.
Luke,They can't be bullies. They're nerds.
Cameron,Is there an issue here?
Alex,"Uncle Cam, I got this."
Alex,"Problem here, boys?"
Luke,These geeks won't give us back our helicopter that we took from Reuben.
Alex,"Is that right, Abraham?"
Alex,"Helicopter, please."
Haley,What just happened?
Alex,"You have your fans, I have mine. Some day, your fans are going to work for my fans."
Claire,"Oh, um, Gloria, do you mind if I talk to Mitchell alone for a minute?"
Gloria,"It's okay. I already know what you said, and I think it's crazy. Mitchell is not making me his mommy."
Claire,"No, I know. He's not, but I think that I might be."
Gloria,"Okay, now you're going really, really crazy, because I am younger than you."
Claire,"Mm, by 14 months, so let's settle down."
Mitchell,What is going on with you today?
Claire,"I... all right, I'm working this out as I go. I think maybe seeing you get all buddy-buddy today with Gloria made me feel like it did when you were with mom, and... and... I don't know. I-I felt like the odd man out."
Mitchell,"Okay. Well, that... that's how I used to feel with you and dad."
Claire,"I know. I know. We... we chose teams, even during the divorce. It... Okay, the last couple years, you and I have been our own team. You know? And I don't want that to go away. So... I guess I just felt a little left out today."
Mitchell,Shut up.
Gloria,"Okay, can you two try hugging a box so that your poor mother doesn't have to do all the hard work?"
Claire,"I am sorry, Gloria, about all the mom stuff today. I just... I got this crazy idea that you liked Mitchell better than me."
Gloria,I do like Mitchell better than you.
Claire,What?
Gloria,"Ay, please. Are you going to honestly tell me that I'm your favorite person in this family? I'm not even your favorite Colombian in this family. I would love to get closer to you. You have my number. But call me quickly because I book up."
Jay,You never saw me.
Phil,There you are. I really need to talk to you.
Jay,You really don't.
Phil,"Jay, please. It's about work. I got a text during your massage. I've been offered a partnership in a new agency."
Jay,Oh. Good for you!
Phil,"I'm not so sure. I mean, there's... there's a big upside, but I have a stable job right now. I have three kids, and at least one of them's going to college. Worse case scenario, they all go."
Jay,"Well, what does Claire think?"
Phil,I haven't told her yet. I wanted to talk to you first. You've done this.
Jay,"Well, I think that there's only really one question."
Phil,Whether I'm ready to run my own company?
Jay,"Ah, you're great with people. We know you're a good salesman. You've managed to provide a good living in tough times."
Phil,Then what? Is this the right time?
Jay,"Never a perfect time. House could burn down tomorrow. Question is, do you want this?"
Phil,"Yeah. Yeah, I really want it."
Jay,Then gamble on yourself. I'd gamble on you.
Phil,I'm gonna do it.
Jay,There you go!
Phil,"Thanks, Jay. Hey, look, I know you were reluctant to get that massage, but I think we can both agree it had a happy ending."
Jay,Please don't say that.
Jay,"If I could only save one possession in a fire, probably my first set of golf clubs. My old man gave 'em to me."
Gloria,The engagement ring that Jay gave me that changed my life.
Mitchell,Lily's adoption papers.
Cameron,"I was gonna say adoption papers. So I guess, then, I would say my mom's recipe book."
Phil,"All our family photos... Which I keep on my iPad, so my iPad."
Claire,"As long as I have my family, I wouldn't need anything else. What?"
Phil,"You say something like that, it makes us all seem petty."
Claire,Yeah. Well... I know.
Mitchell,Shh! Cam's sleeping. I don't wanna wake him.
Haley,He's had a rough day.
Alex,Not as rough as grandpa's truck.
Mitchell,Shh! Thank you so much for driving me. I really didn't want to ride in that big rig.
Alex,"It was amazing. Everybody was honking, and I learned, like, five new curse words."
Haley,Mostly from Cam.
Cameron,"Oh, I'm glad I could give you a laugh today. You know, I didn't know that's what I was to you people a big joke."
Mitchell,"No, honey, it wasn't like that."
Alex,"No, we really didn't mean..."
Haley,"Uncle Cam, we love you."
Cameron,Save it. I'm going back to bed.
Haley,So he's still doing that?
Mitchell,"Yeah. Yeah, but we're working on it."
Phil,"Oh, my goodness, those hands are cold! At least buy me dinner first!"
Luke,Boom!
Claire,Tell my wife and kids I love them.
Phil,"Oh, my God."
Luke,"That's kind of dark, mom."
Claire,What?
Phil,"Wait, what's my favourite hospital food?"
Claire,Ummm.
Phil,"Jell-o! Hey buddy. No, today's still good."
Claire,Good for what? Who's buddy?
Phil,"Yeah, just head on over the house."
Claire,Whose house? Who's buddy?
Phil,"Ok, see you in a couple."
Claire,Couple of what? Who's buddy?
Phil,Kenneth.
Claire,Kenneth?
Phil,Kenneth!
Phil,"If I had a son, I'd want him to be like Kenneth Ploufe."
Claire,You do have a son.
Phil,"When we first moved in here, he was the sweet kid who lived next door."
Claire,"Mm, the weird kid who lived next door, but Phil always had a soft spot for him because Kenneth sort of looked up to him."
Phil,I wouldn't say hero.
Claire,And yet you did.
Phil,"Well, you weren't going to. Claire's always had some issues with Kenneth."
Claire,He would stare at me a little too long.
Phil,Can you blame him? You used to dress sexy back then.
Claire,Mnh-mnh.
Claire,"Oh, wow, that's a lot of hugging."
Phil,Oh! She's right. Why hug when you can... Man-shake.
Claire,I'm gonna get the coffee.
Claire,"""Man-shake."" Are we sure?"
Phil,Roll up the curtain. Bing!
Cameron,I think I have to tell my punkin chunkin story.
Mitchell,"Oh, no, no, you don't have to."
Cameron,"No, I kind of think I have to."
Mitchell,"Once, Cam and his friends tried to slingshot a pumpkin across a football field. Three seconds. That's all he needs to tell that story."
Cameron,"So the fog was rolling in over the mountains like an ominous blanket as we readied the giant slingshot. You know, Lorna, the pastor's daughter, she was nervous because like I said, it was after curfew. She was a goody two-shoe. Only pastor's daughter I ever met that was. So we finally launch the pumpkin, and it sails through the air, goalpost to goalpost... past the end zone, into the parking lot, through the open roof of Lorna's dad's car. I turn to Cody and I say, ""now what are the chances of that landing there?"" He says, ""where?"" And I say... ""The sunroof of a preacher man."""
Mitchell,Wah-wah.
Manny,"Okay, come on in! Voila!"
Gloria,Ah!
Jay,"Okay, what are we looking at?"
Manny,My centerpiece for Thanksgiving.
Gloria,It is wonderful. You're so talented. I can't believe that you did this.
Manny,"Yeah, my juices were really flowing on this one. I actually shot a making-of video. Hey, maybe we can watch it later at the party."
Jay,"Well, yeah, that or football."
Gloria,"Mi amor, I'm so proud of you. Is there nothing in the world that you can't do?"
Jay,"Centerpieces, for starters."
Gloria,Shh!
Jay,"Why do you say everything of his is great, even if it isn't?"
Gloria,Because I'm building him up. That's what parents do.
Jay,"Too much, if you ask me. Kids cross the street nowadays, they get a ribbon. Manny's got plenty of confidence. He just needs a little reality check every now and then. And this thing is a horn of ugly."
Gloria,Shh! My mother used to criticize everything I did. And look at me now. I am a jumble of insecurities.
Jay,I'm not getting that.
Gloria,Do not say a word to Manny.
Jay,"Fine. But trust me, if you told him the truth, he'd thank you later."
Gloria,Mm. Like Claire and Mitch? Did they thank you?
Jay,Not yet.
Gloria,Mm.
Jay,No. But it's coming.
Phil,Yeah.
Luke,We have a lot.
Phil,So what have you been up to? I haven't seen you since you went off to college.
Claire,"Mm, so without the benefit of a college degree, I guess your options were kind of limited, huh?"
Haley,Ease up. It's a holiday.
Claire,Oh. Okay.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Claire,"Oh, was that also in the dish or cleaning industry?"
Phil,Holy crow.
Haley,"Ohh. Wow. So if you... if you'd gone to college, you would have done all that just four years later, or... or never."
Claire,"Alex really needs to be picked up, sweetie. Why don't you go get her?"
Haley,I wanna hear more of what he has to say about...
Claire,We're leaving.
Phil,"Kenneth, I am so proud of you. You really made it."
Luke,"Oh, you mean like..."
Phil,Shh. Luke. Let the man talk.
Claire,Your lung?
Phil,Record scratch!
Phil,He's me... And he's spectacular.
Alex,"Oh, my God. Kenneth Ploufe is part owner of a resort in the Bahamas, some cruise line, and Lacy Fair, that lingerie company."
Haley,Oh! Ew! I'm wearing one of his bras!
Alex,"Look, he's got a model in his lap."
Haley,No way.
Alex,Look at her.
Haley,This is your fault!
Alex,This is your fault!
Haley,Are you seriously gonna stay in here all day?
Alex,"I can't face mom. If I see her, I'm gonna have to confess."
Haley,"Take a breather. It's just a dent. And saying nothing is not lying, okay? It's just letting the truth speak for itself."
Alex,This is not the time for moral equivocation.
Haley,"Okay, I don't know what that means, and also, don't tell me."
Alex,You're the one who's gonna lose her driving privileges. I don't know why you're so calm.
Haley,"All we have to do is keep it from mom until she goes to the store. Then, when she sees it, she'll assume that it happened there, which it did, so it's not really lying."
Alex,Listen to you. Are you gonna be a career criminal?
Haley,Ugh. You sound like mom. I don't know what I'm gonna do after High School.
Mitchell,"It was a supportive ""wah-wah."" I was trying to save the moment."
Cameron,"There's no such thing as a supportive ""wah-wah."" A ""wah-wah"" by its very nature is vicious and undercutting."
Mitchell,"Well, I was just trying to salvage that story, okay? I told you not to tell it, you told it, and it died."
Cameron,It did not die. It's a thinker.
Mitchell,"Cam, the only thing people were thinking was, ""thank God this story's over."""
Cameron,Okay. I get it. So how long have I been embarrassing you with my stories?
Mitchell,"No, no, no, no. You don't embarrass me. I love your stories, okay? The tractor in the swimming hole? Aunt Betty's wiglet on the piglet?"
Cameron,Uncle Carl said she couldn't tell 'em apart.
Mitchell,See? Those are funny. You have so many great ones.
Cameron,"Well, that's farm life. Rain or shine, there's always a bumper crop of stories."
Mitchell,"Yeah, I'm just saying maybe you take punkin chunkin out of the rotation."
Cameron,I guess you're right. Maybe I could just...
Mitchell,"Yeah, stick to the ones that really happened, because people love those."
Cameron,Excuse me. What?
Mitchell,I'm... I'm just saying people laugh more at stories that are true.
Cameron,Punkin chunkin is a true story.
Mitchell,True-ish?
Cameron,No. True.
Mitchell,"Really? The length of a football field, through the sunroof of a car that was open in late November in Missouri?"
Cameron,It was unseasonably warm.
Mitchell,That explains the fog rolling over the hill. And who's Cody... who you're close enough to chunk with but mysteriously only appears in this story?
Cameron,"Cody was K.I.A. in Desert Storm. He's a hero. You know, all this from someone who's never even chunked a punkin."
Mitchell,"Well, I've never lunked a tunkin, either. You know, these aren't real things."
Phil,"This'll work, right?"
Luke,"Totally, dad."
Phil,"Why have one long table when you can use four little ones bistro style? I'll bet this is how the French do Thanksgiving. You don't mind sitting with your Uncle Mitch and, uh, grandpa, do you?"
Luke,Anything's better than watching Lily chew.
Phil,"By the way, this is the side of your old man that Kenneth was talking about. Original. Imaginative. Fearless."
Luke,"So Kenneth became a gajillionaire by asking himself, ""what would Phil do?"""
Phil,He sure did. Where did that come from? Right?
Luke,But you're you. Why aren't we gajillionaires? Why don't you do what Phil would do?
Claire,"Phil, why didn't you just put the extra leaves in the table?"
Phil,"Trying to have some fun, be creative."
Claire,"One long table, honey. If it was good enough for the last supper, it's good enough for us."
Manny,I'm having second thoughts about this centerpiece.
Gloria,"Ay, no."
Jay,Hear him out.
Manny,"I just think if we bring it to Phil and Claire's, we'll never see it again, right?"
Jay,That's the plan.
Manny,"Well, that would be sad. Except maybe my sadness will inspire me to create something even greater. Remember that collage I made that helped us get through Katrina?"
Gloria,Mm-hmm.
Jay,You did this. You know that.
Manny,So... is this the legendary rice pilaf we've been hearing about?
Jay,"Try for yourself. Used to make it every year, but it, uh, started to upstage the Turkey. Something wrong?"
Manny,Not so much wrong as missing. It... it just tastes a little flat.
Jay,That a fact?
Manny,"I just think with the earthiness of the rice, you might want something zesty to set it off. I think this might be a job for cumin."
Jay,"You know, since we're sharing helpful criticisms..."
Gloria,"No, no, no, no. Nobody's sharing anything. Manny, go change for the party."
Jay,"No, no, no, but I appreciate helpful criticisms. It, uh, it's important for me that I hear the truth. Makes me stronger, less of a mama's boy."
Manny,"Yeah, mom, he can take it."
Gloria,"That's what he says, but you don't really know what he feels underneath. Some people are so sensitive, that they hear one criticism, and it kills the spark that made them special."
Manny,I think I know what's going on here.
Jay,Good.
Manny,"This is about you and your mom, isn't it?"
Gloria,"Yes, it is."
Jay,"No, it isn't."
Gloria,"Yes, it is! Manny, don't upset me anymore. Go. Go change."
Manny,What... what should I wear?
Gloria,"Ay, you look good in everything!"
Alex,"Where you going, mom?"
Claire,"Mm, I gotta run to the store. Someone ate all the marshmallows."
Haley,"Hey, can I tell you something? I was thinking that maybe after new year's break, we could visit a couple more colleges."
Claire,Seriously?
Haley,I was so hard on you before. I'm sorry. I know I'm no Kenneth. I'm gonna need all the help that I can get.
Claire,"Honey, I am so proud of you. Oh. Oh, thank you."
Haley,Mm-hmm.
Claire,"Oh, okay."
Haley,What are you doing?
Claire,"Oh, Uncle Mitch is picking up the marshmallows."
Haley,"Then again, backpacking through Europe could be educational in its own way."
Claire,"No! No, no! No, no, no! Do you know what's illegal in Europe? Nothing! You are going to college!"
Haley,"Okay, fine."
Claire,Darn right it's fine.
Haley,Piece of cake.
Alex,My hair's coming out!
Claire,"Wow, honey. I-I think you could make these simpler. Just, you know, sort of do 'em flat and on the side."
Phil,Hmm. Yeah. Seems like that's how you like me. Flat and on the side. You know what? Sometimes I need to be puffed up and frilly.
Claire,"All right, is this one of those moments I'm gonna have to remember later when they ask me if there were any signs?"
Phil,This is what Phil would do... make fantastic napkin origami that startles and delights his guests.
Claire,"I know, but, sweetie, they're just looking a little..."
Phil,"Claire, you always do this. You squelch me. You squelch me right when I'm about to soar."
Claire,"Honey, you're folding napkins."
Phil,"You're folding my dreams! You know what Kenneth told me? The secret to his success... his whole career, he's tried to emulate me. The only difference is, he hasn't had someone constantly telling him what not to do."
Claire,"So the only reason we don't have a... a blimp tethered to our mailbox is because I'm always shooting down your great ideas? Yeah. Let's review the squelch pile, Phil. Let's see... the rice pudding franchise."
Phil,Works for all chewing abilities.
Claire,Adult tricycles.
Phil,Just try to fall off.
Claire,The aspirin gun.
Phil,Some people have a hard time swallowing! And you left one out.
Claire,Hmm.
Phil,"And that, my dear Claire, is a real head-scratcher... ""TM."""
Phil,"Action. Hey, friend. You look like you had a rough day at the office."
Luke,"The stress from my job at the robot assassin factory... It's too much to take. Aw, shoot me an aspirin, pal."
Phil,"Maybe someday. But until then, try this on for size. The real head- scratcher features 32 patent-pending ""nogginizers"" that gently massage your scalp in a soothing purr of motorized delight."
Luke,"Ahh. It feels great, and it looks good, too. It's a real lifesaver."
Phil,"You mean a real head-scratcher? ""TM."""
Claire,"I love you, Phil, but you..."
Phil,"Stop. I love your ""I love you."" I'm getting awful tired of your ""but."" I heard it."
Alex,"Welcome, welcome, welcome! Happy Turkey day! Hey, is that a new car?"
Jay,"Yep! It's the best, isn't it?"
Alex,"I can't take my eyes off it. You shouldn't, either."
Gloria,"Are you okay, mami?"
Alex,I'm... I'm...
Haley,"Hey, guys! Now the party's started. Come on! How are you?"
Gloria,Good.
Alex,You disgust me.
Haley,Are you hungry?
Manny,"Oh, good. It's still in one piece. You hit those potholes pretty hard. It's like you didn't see 'em."
Jay,"No, I saw 'em."
Manny,"Can I be honest with you, Jay? I'm getting the sense that you're not the biggest fan of ""Allegria""?"
Jay,"You got a name for it now? Great. All right. Cards on the table? This is not your best work. Now look, don't get me wrong. You're a talented kid. You're gonna be a big success in the world. But this... this is a swing and a miss."
Manny,"Well, but my mom said it was..."
Gloria,"It's great, yeah, I know. But how did she say it?"
Manny,What do you mean?
Jay,"There's a big difference between ""it's great,"" and ""it's great."" You hear that? ""It's great,"" and ""it's greeeat."""
Manny,All I hear is a bunch of people telling me I'm great.
Jay,"And that's a problem, because a lot of times people will lie to you to protect your feelings, and that's not doing you any favors. You get a lot farther in life if you know what you're good at and what you're not. Now you can handle that, right?"
Manny,Yeah.
Jay,"Of course you can. How you doing, honey?"
Alex,I'm greeeat.
Claire,"Okay, everybody, come on! Two minutes till dinner! Get ready! Oh, wow, Manny. What have you got there?"
Gloria,He made a centerpiece!
Phil,"Oh, that's fantastic."
Cameron,It's stunning.
Manny,It's garbage.
Gloria,"No, no, no! What are you doing? It's so beautiful!"
Manny,Stop the lies. Jay told me the truth.
Gloria,What did you say?
Jay,I mentioned it wasn't his best effort.
Manny,He said it was a swing and a miss.
Gloria,"Why?! Why do you say these things, Jay?! It's like I married my mother!"
Cameron,"Jay, why would you do that?"
Phil,"Because he's a Pritchett. But don't let these negative nellies drag you down, Manny, because one day you could have a trillion-dollar idea that the people who supposedly love you most..."
Claire,"Okay, Phil! That's it. Go get the head-scratcher."
Phil,"The real head-scratcher, ""TM""?"
Claire,"Go get it, and let everybody else decide how many trillions I've cost you."
Phil,Way ahead of you.
Mitchell,What's going on here?
Phil,"We are about to make hat history. Or as I like to call it, ""hatstory."" Early man had hours and hours to scratch his weary head. But what about today's busy times? Thank you, squire. Great thing about this? You can wear it anywhere. Hit it, buddy. Oh! It's like a thousand tiny angels are line dancing on my sca... I... it looks like we got a slight malfunction in a rear nogginizer. Oh! Shut her down! Shut her down, buddy!"
Luke,It's not working!
Phil,"My hair! It's got my hair! Okay! Fine. That... I'm fine. Forgot about that feature. It's an exfoliating... scrub. Buddy, can you grab the safety shears?"
Cameron,"You know what, Phil? Keep it up. And I admire you and Manny. I know what it's like to stare down skepticism from a loved one."
Mitchell,"Cam, not now."
Cameron,Why not now? It's Thanksgiving. Families gather. Issues come up.
Jay,Only if you bring them up.
Cameron,"It's healthy to get things out in the open. Y'all know my punkin chunkin story, or do you need a refresher?"
Jay,We've heard it.
Claire,"Oh, several times."
Gloria,I love it. With Cody and the friends?
Cameron,"Yes. So you know how it ends. But the question is, who here thinks I made that up?"
Claire,Oh.
Cameron,"Oh. Well, doesn't that tell the whole story right there? Here we have the skeptics, the dream-squashers... The Pritchetts. And here we have the dreamers, the artists, the visionaries."
Phil,Sweet Caroline!
Jay,So we're supposed to believe that you make a... a pumpkin fly across a football field.
Cameron,I can prove it to you right now. Let's go to the football field.
Mitchell,Yes! Let's do this. I'd love to end this.
Phil,Yeah! Let's settle this! Dreamers versus Pritchetts!
Gloria,Bravo! Bravo!
Claire,"No, no, no! Hold it! I did not just cook for eight hours so you people could run off to prove some asinine point that's only gonna make half of us feel bad! Come on! Show a little respect."
Jay,"Turkey smells great, sweetheart."
Phil,Is that Turkey? Because something smells like chicken.
Claire,"Okay, let's settle this."
Gloria,"Yeah. Vamos, vamos! Jay, I drive!"
Luke,This is the coolest thing ever.
Gloria,"Okay, I want to film. Ay, no, wait, I want to be in it."
Manny,"Hey, Cam, are you sure this is going to work?"
Cameron,"Oh, God, you sound just like Cody."
Luke,Do you think this could launch a human?
Phil,Luke... Let's do the pumpkin first.
Luke,Okay.
Jay,"They're having fun over there, but you know it's gonna end in tears."
Mitchell,"Yeah, always does."
Claire,Knock-knock. Who's there? Physics.
Mitchell,Thank you.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Luke,Who's gonna be able to launch it?
Phil,I think it should be Cam!
Cameron,"Oh, no! I think it should be all of us!"
Gloria,All of us! All of us!
Claire,"For the record, I don't squash all of Phil's dreams, just the ones that are, you know, potentially fatal."
Jay,I'm just trying to get the kid ready for life.
Mitchell,"Yeah. Yes, i-if we didn't do this to them, the world would."
Phil,Get ready to eat some crow!
Gloria,It is not as delicious as it sounds. Okay... Uno! Dos! Tres! Three!
Phil,Yeah!
Manny,"What happened, Cam?"
Cameron,I don't know. I-I don't know.
Luke,Can we do it again?
Gloria,"No, we only had one pumpkin, and we just chunk it."
Jay,"Well, we were right."
Claire,"Aw, yeah. Ha!"
Cameron,"I'm sorry, guys."
Claire,"This usually feels a little better, doesn't it?"
Mitchell,"Yeah. All right. I-I hate to admit it, but when they put the pumpkin in, I was kind of hoping it would work."
Jay,Yeah.
Claire,"Me, too."
Mitchell,Huh.
Cameron,All right! Let the gloating begin.
Jay,"You know, it was a pretty good try."
Phil,We don't need your pity. Let's just get this stuff cleaned up.
Mitchell,"Well... or if... if maybe we, um... we launch it from a steeper angle?"
Claire,Yeah.
Jay,"Then... maybe if you had somebody else you know, helping you pull the thing."
Luke,But we don't have any more pumpkins.
Claire,That's the easy part! They're on every porch up and down the block.
Jay,"Oh, we can handle that. Come on, kid!"
Mitchell,Yeah.
Phil,Come on. Let's try one.
Cameron,"There are dreamers and there are realists in this world. You'd think the dreamers would find the dreamers and the realists would find the realists, but more often than not, the opposite is true."
Manny,"Maybe if this works, we should launch my centerpiece next."
Jay,It wasn't that bad.
Manny,Your rice pilaf was.
Gloria,"Jay, be careful!"
Mitchell,Okay. All right.
Cameron,"Oh! Oh! Keep going, keep going! Keep going!"
Gloria,Ohh!
Cameron,"You see, the dreamers need the realists to keep them from soaring too close to the sun. And the realists... Well, without the dreamers, they might not ever get off the ground."
Mitchell,"Okay! Next one's going through the... the goal thingy, I can feel it!"
Cameron,"Now when Lorna, Cody, and I did this, it was..."
Jay,"Less talkin', more chunkin."
Alex,"Mom, I need to tell you something."
Claire,"What is it, honey?"
Cameron,Ready!
Alex,"I distracted Haley while she was driving, and we dented your car."
Cameron,Fire!
Claire,Ohh!
Luke,Yeah!
Claire,"Well, girls... three more seconds, and you would have gotten away with it."
Alex,Mm.
Haley,Mm.
Luke,"Now a human? Come here, Lily."
Phil,"Luke, no."
Gloria,"Ay, finally!"
Cameron,Look who's wearing her itsy bitsy bikini.
Phil,He can comment because he's raggay.
Claire,He was talking about Lily.
Phil,So was I.
Gloria,"Ay, Cam, you make her look so pretty."
Mitchell,Guess who's not coming for Christmas.
Cameron,And the spotlight shifts.
Mitchell,Mom. She cancelled.
Claire,What?
Mitchell,"In a voice mail, no less."
Claire,"Unbelievable... and by that, I mean believable."
Haley,Why isn't Nana coming?
Mitchell,I don't know. Something about her new boyfriend whisking her away on a cruise.
Jay,I just got my gift.
Claire,What boyfriend?
Alex,Carl the cruise ship captain. It was in her holiday newsletter.
Claire,"Oh, I can't read that whole thing. No."
Cameron,"Yeah, after two pages about the bird she rescued..."
Phil,"And by the way, I don't think you can say you rescued something if it dies."
Cameron,It died?
Jay,She wrote a poem about it.
Manny,"A little too free with the free verse for my taste, but fine, we'll call it a poem."
Mitchell,I stopped reading after she talked about suing her book club.
Claire,"Oh, I stopped reading after ""dear friends,family and others... "" I'm sorry. Who are ""others""?"
Gloria,Me.
Jay,"No,you're not... Uh,maybe you are."
Phil,"Actually, she's kind of at her best at Christmas. She makes a mean cookie."
Claire,What other kind could she possibly make?
Gloria,"Ay, it's so sad that you guys are not gonna be with your mom this Christmas."
Mitchell,It's fine.
Claire,"Yeah, it's more than fine. Let's just... Can we move off of mom?"
Mitchell,"Yes, please."
Cameron,"Yeah, and the upside now, Mitchell... We can spend Christmas in Missouri where it actually feels like Christmas."
Claire,"Wait. Hang on a second. Just because mom isn't coming doesn't mean we're not gonna spend Christmas together. I mean, it's about family."
Cameron,"Who do you think we're seeing in Missouri, Claire, the oak ridge boys?"
Jay,Hold on. I thought we were all getting together Christmas eve this year. We're on a flight to Mexico the 25th.
Claire,"What do you mean, you're getting on a flight on the 25th?"
Jay,You two needed time with your mom. I've already served my time with your mom.
Claire,"Oh, dad."
Mitchell,"Well, uh, well, when are we gonna have Christmas then?"
Luke,I heard kids are getting snatched in Mexico.
Manny,What?
Gloria,Kids get snatched here just as much. It happens all the time. Don't be scared.
Manny,"Now when you say ""all the time""..."
Mitchell,"okay, well what about next weekend? 'Cause we don't leave till the 21st, right?"
Claire,"Yeah, we leave tomorrow and we don't come back until the 21st."
Haley,"Hey, math club, could you get me some more lemonade?"
Claire,Are we saying that this is the last time we're all gonna be together as a family until after the holidays?
Luke,"And for you, maybe ever."
Mitchell,"Well, this stinks."
Cameron,"Yeah, we can't do this. This is not right."
Claire,We always spend Christmas together.
Mitchell,"Yeah, we have to do something about it."
Phil,"Ho, ho, hold up a sec. We're all free today. We've got four hours to shop, cook, wrap, get a tree. By tonight, we could be celebrating Christmas, right?"
Mitchell,I... I guess we could do that.
Phil,"Of course we can! Have you ever heard of express Christmas? No. No, you haven't, because I just invented it. Express Christmas, ""tm."" It's when you can't have it on Christmas day..."
Cameron,I got it.
Phil,And you have to scramble.
Jay,Get on with it!
Phil,We're wasting time! We're wasting time! Everyone in the house! We'll make a plan! Time is of the-oh! Ow! Hot! Hot! It's just too hot!
Claire,"Oh, Phil!"
Jay,"So we're really doing this, huh?"
Mitchell,Yes.
Jay,'Cause I had stuff lined up for Christmas eve.
Gloria,"Yeah, Jay. It's Manny's last chance to enjoy a family Christmas."
Manny,"Until next year, you mean."
Luke,"Well, with all the snatchings..."
Manny,"Get out of my head, Luke!"
Phil,"Okay, who's gonna get the tree?"
Mitchell,"Oh! I will. I will. Because, you know, get the wrong kind, people get upset."
Claire,You get upset.
Mitchell,I'm people.
Phil,"Fine, I'll get the turkey. What about gifts?"
Gloria,"Jay, did we finish shopping?"
Jay,"Yeah, but we're not wrapped."
Cameron,"Oh, I can help with that. We have a mobile wrapping station. God, has that thing paid for itself."
Mitchell,Really? 'cause I feel like I paid for it.
Phil,Okay. We've got lights and ornaments at our place.
Mitchell,Oh! You know what would be great? It's the angel!
Claire,The angel. Yeah. Where is it?
Mitchell,"Oh. Um, Gloria, it's up in your attic. Would you get it?"
Gloria,"Ay, no! Not the attic! It's dirty, and there are spiders."
Mitchell,"Oh, but it really won't be Christmas without it."
Jay,Won't be Christmas with it. It's December 16th.
Phil,Luke will help Gloria. He's not scared.
Manny,"Oh, good. You won't find me in any attic."
Luke,That may be exactly where they find you.
Manny,Mom!
Haley,"Uh, I have a party tonight. You promised I could go if I got a ""b"" on my test. I studied. I read stuff. What was the point of all that?"
Claire,"The point, young lady, is for..."
Phil,"Who can remember? Express Christmas will be done by 9:00. Claire, I'll text you the gift list."
Claire,Okay.
Phil,"You and Haley do the shopping. Manny, you're coming with me. We're"
Claire,"Come on, Haley. It'll be fun. A lot of fun. We can go to target. Okay?"
Phil,"Come on, let's go!"
Mitchell,"So it's-it's just me and Lily getting the tree, then? Hello?"
Alex,"My mom tells me it's ""xmas"" in a text?"
Mitchell,"Yeah, well, my mom canceled in a voice mail and told me she had a boyfriend in a newsletter, so... Join the team. Put some clothes on. We're getting a tree. Wait. Hold on."
Gloria,Luke!
Luke,At what?
Gloria,"What do you mean, ""at what""? I said ""Luke."""
Luke,I am looking.
Gloria,"I know you are. Stay on the beams. Maybe it's here. Ay, dios mio! El Diablo! It's back! What is so special about that angel, anyways?"
Luke,I don't know. I guess nana made it for mom and uncle Mitchell when they were kids.
Gloria,"Ay, that's nice. Look where you're going!"
Luke,"To open more boxes. oh, you said ""look where you're going,"" didn't you?"
Gloria,Yes.
Luke,"Every time you say ""Luke,"" I think you're saying ""look."""
Gloria,I don't hear the difference.
Luke,It's not that hard. One is my name.
Gloria,"Juan is not your name! Stop kidding around and look, Luke. Ay, I get it. ""look"" sounds like ""Luke."""
Luke,Yes. Thank god. I've been carrying that one around for three years.
Haley,Ugh. There's like a hundred things on this list.
Claire,I know but it's just the two of us. It's fun.
Haley,"Okay, it's not fake mother's day. Ugh! This place is huge! oh, plus we have to cook dinner! This is impossible."
Claire,"Listen to me. Your whole life has led to this moment. All the training, the hours of dedication... There's not a soul alive who can touch you when it comes to shopping, and, baby, you know it. Look at me. Be you."
Haley,Give me that list.
Claire,Never been more proud in my life. Come on.
Haley,No. This way.
Alex,What about this one?
Mitchell,"Let's see. No. No. I'm sorry, I know I'm being really o.c.d. Right now, but there's something very particular that I'm looking for. It needs to be a douglas fir, at least 8 feet tall, and look good from all sides."
Alex,Exactly. No bald spots.
Mitchell,"Yes. Thank you. Thank you. The key is symmetry, right? How come we never go shopping together?"
Alex,Because I hate shopping.
Mitchell,"I do, too! Okay, this one."
Alex,"Wait. Oh. No, no, no."
Mitchell,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Alex,"Okay, wow. Just because my uncle is clearly gay... doesn't mean he'd ever want your tacky pink tree. And frankly, we'd rather throw some lights on a coatrack than have to deal with knuckle-draggers like you today of all days. December 16th."
Mitchell,"Okay, first of all, amazing. Second of all..."
Mitchell,"Second of all, uh, we're-we're gonna go ahead and take, uh, this-this tree..."
Alex,That one.
Mitchell,And we're going to tie it onto our car ourselves.
Mitchell,"He gets it, Lily."
Alex,Yeah.
Cameron,Oh. Finger.
Jay,All right.
Cameron,"Cam and Jay-you know, sort of sounds like a bird. ""the migratory patterns of the Cam and Jay... """
Jay,Do you have any more tape in that thing?
Cameron,"Do I have more tape in that? I got a tank full of tape, mister. What do you want? Invisible? Satin finish? Uh, double sided?"
Jay,Whatever. Whatever.
Cameron,Okay. That's interesting.
Jay,"I doubt that it is,but what?"
Cameron,"Well, I mean the way you wrap a gift. That's a lot of tape. Nobody can get in. Kind of like... You know... I mean, well, you let me in, but in general,w... Why so much tape, Jay?"
Jay,Why are you wearing a sweater when it's 95 degrees out?
Cameron,It's my Christmas sweater.
Jay,"Based on those stains, you are the Christmas sweater."
Cameron,"Well, who's been a very good boy? So... Okay. Are we gonna talk about the elephant in the room, which is ironic because it's so tiny?"
Jay,A man doesn't give another man a gift this small.
Cameron,"Oh, what do you think it is, a ring?"
Jay,Was there wine with this cork?
Cameron,"Yes, there was, and we drank it on..."
Jay,"Oh, we drank it on, uh... eh? Yeah. Um... On that boat."
Cameron,You have no idea.
Jay,"I can't even remember my own anniversary, Cam. How would I have remembered having had wine with my son's boyfriend?"
Cameron,"No, I do this. This is my fault. I... I attach too much meaning to things. I mean, we watched our first football game together five years ago, and I feel the need to save the cork from the bottle of wine you served. I mean, who does that? It's not your only gift, by the way. There's a duplicate bottle in that box right over there which I had engraved with the date and the final score, because I have a problem. I feel too much. I gotta get going to Claire's."
Jay,Cam...
Cameron,No. Fresh wound. Can't talk yet.
Jay,Fine. We'll put a cork in it.
Cameron,"Let it scab, Jay. Let it scab."
Haley,"Oh, there you are. I thought I'd lost you."
Claire,"Oh, I'm sorry. I may have taken a few minutes to try out a futon. It's a young woman's game. Okay. Where do we stand?"
Haley,I think we have everything.
Claire,Yes!
Haley,Oh... Except the ladybug night-light for Lily.
Claire,"Haley, your whole life has led up..."
Haley,"Oh, I got it, mom, I got it."
Claire,"Okay, okay, I'll b... I'll see you in line."
Claire,Or maybe I just want paper. Paper. Paper. Just paper all the way. Yeah! Haley! Too late to change my mind?
Haley,"Sir, would you like me to hold your merchandise up at the register while you finish shopping?"
Claire,"Pack of gum. And... One more pack of gum. People drop in this time of year, you know."
Haley,"Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me. Sorry. Excuse me. Night-light you were looking for, ma'am. Ring her up, Madison."
Claire,Thank you. There you go.
Manny,You're leaving me alone here?
Phil,"No, no, no, no. I... It'll, uh, it'll just take me two minutes. I need to get Jay's super secret special gift."
Manny,"Great. First you lose me in the grocery store, now I'm in a deserted parking lot. Why don't you just put a sign on me that says ""free kid""?"
Phil,I think that might be him.
Manny,You don't know the guy we're meeting?
Phil,That's how craigslist works. Total strangers sell you things like signed vintage baseball cards that make your father-in-law respect you for an afternoon.
Manny,I don't like the looks of this guy.
Phil,He looks like everybody else.
Manny,Great. You can just tell that to the police sketch artist.
Phil,"Phil Dunphy, but I get that a lot. Kidding. I'm your guy."
Phil,Yes. Can I... Can I see the card? Mint condition.
Phil,I only have the $200.
Phil,Come on. It's Christmas... At our house. It's a long story.
Phil,I just spent all my cash on groceries.
Phil,I don't know about that.
Manny,That's it. I'm getting mother's little helper.
Phil,What?
Manny,My mom keeps a stun gun for emergencies.
Phil,This isn't an emergen... Eeh! Now it is.
Manny,I thought he was going to snatch me.
Phil,A butterball is a turkey.
Manny,What'd he say?
Manny,"Oh. Well, we can't give you our turkey."
Phil,"Yes, we can. And... Here's the... Money. Joe Dimaggio. Joe Dimaggio. Mint condit... Near-mint con... Fair condit... Garbage."
Luke,"Huh. Never saw this before. ""an angel for my angels. Love, mom."""
Gloria,"Oh, that's beautiful."
Luke,"And it smells like mothballs, just like nana."
Gloria,Luke...
Mitchell,Thank-merry Christmas...
Alex,Just... just give it up. He hates us.
Mitchell,"Don't beat yourself up. I do that, like, once a week. The good news is, we never have to come back here."
Alex,Watch out! The tree!
Mitchell,I can't watch!
Luke,Look!
Gloria,"Ay, yes, I said ""Luke."" You told me already. I did it right!"
Luke,No! Look!
Gloria,Never look back. Never!
Alex,Maybe we can salvage it?
Gloria,"Are you okay, papi?"
Luke,Yeah.
Gloria,Good. That's because we had our guardian angel. Ay! A spider!
Haley,"Hey, mom? Check it."
Claire,"The gum! Oh, and you made it pretty. Honey, put it on the table."
Haley,New tradition?
Claire,"Oh, yes. Yes."
Gloria,"Hmmm, Christmas gum. I take one."
Jay,"Tough to decorate the tree with no tree, huh?"
Cameron,Yeah.
Jay,"How long you gonna ignore me, Cam?"
Cameron,"Until the shame cloud clears. You know, I push. I'm a pusher."
Jay,"You gotta give yourself a break. See, the thing about me, I'm not as open with feelings as you. You've gotta lower your expectations."
Cameron,"Oh, I get it. Baby steps."
Jay,No steps. This is it.
Cameron,"See? Did it again. Push! Push, push, push, push. Now I've pushed you out of the room. That's fine."
Gloria,How is she?
Luke,"I got the tire marks off her wings, but I can't get her head to stay on."
Gloria,"Okay, that's what this is for. Now stick it in the top of the tree with the good part facing out. Come on."
Jay,"Well, that stuffing looks good. All we need now is a turkey to surround it."
Claire,"Well, relax. Phil just texted, and he's ""on his wax."""
Mitchell,Okay! Here comes the tree.
Jay,Oh! Finally!
Alex,Here comes more of the tree.
Jay,"Hi, honey."
Cameron,"Oh. Oh, my gosh. What happened?"
Mitchell,"Well, uh, someone ran over it, but that's okay 'cause we are gonna put it back together."
Alex,Right now.
Gloria,He's gonna need a lot of gum.
Claire,"Oh, thank god. Here comes Phil and the butterball."
Alex,I have a name.
Phil,"I am sorry, but there is no turkey."
Claire,"There's no turkey? What's the plan, Phil?"
Phil,"Cornish game hens. If you get real close, they look like turkeys, and everyone gets their own."
Jay,Sounds like fun.
Claire,Not fun. Not fun. I asked you to pick up a cooked turkey.
Phil,"The store was out of turkeys. It was an hour to express Christmas. Please, just make it work, okay? Please."
Claire,They're not even defrosted.
Phil,"Fine, Claire. You want 'em defrosted? Merry... Freaking... Christmas!"
Claire,Phil!
Gloria,Is that my stun gun?
Phil,Yep. And it works great.
Claire,"Okay. Okay. Um... We can make this work. This can work. Dad, you and Mitchell reassemble that tree."
Jay,All right.
Claire,"And I am going to defrost these birds, and we'll cook them in shifts, and we'll just push dinner back by a bit."
Haley,"Oh, how long? 'cause I still have my party."
Jay,What the hell happened to the angel?
Gloria,"No! The real question here is, how come we still have the dog butler?"
Jay,"Oh, you found him, huh?"
Mitchell,"Well, this thing is... It's filthy. And... What happened?!"
Gloria,It got run over.
Luke,Probably by the same maniac who ran over the tree.
Mitchell,"Oh, my god. Is that... Yep. Yep, that's gum. That is gum. Okay, I'm... I'm out. I'm done. I am out. No. No turkey, no tree, and now this looks like the lady she used to be before she died and became an angel."
Claire,"All right. Relax, Mitchell. It's an ornament."
Haley,"No, he's right. We're never gonna get this together. I'm going to my party."
Claire,"No, no. No, you're not. You are not. You're staying right here, because you're not going to abandon your family...On Christmas."
Haley,It's not Christmas.
Mitchell,"Exactly. Exactly. It's not Christmas, Claire."
Claire,"Okay, fine! Fine! You know what? I am really tired of trying to make this work on my own. I will see you people in a year."
Alex,And nine days.
Gloria,No! Nobody goes anywhere. I know what the problem is here. You two miss your mommy.
Mitchell,No.
Claire,I do not miss my mommy.
Gloria,"Admit it. It's sad. She used to make you cookies, the angel... Now she talks to you in a newsletter and she cancels for no reason. Come here, my little ones."
Mitchell,"No. We're... Good. No, it's fine."
Claire,We're good. It's not a big deal.
Gloria,It's Christmas. You need a mommy.
Mitchell,You're not mommy.
Gloria,And it's not Christmas. Come here. It's okay to miss her.
Jay,Can I put in my 2 cents on fake Christmas?
Phil,Express Christmas.
Jay,"Let it go, Phil. It's not sticking."
Phil,It needs time.
Jay,"We all gave it our best shot to make this thing work. It just didn't happen, all right? What do you say we cut our losses? Let's go out to a nice Chinese restaurant and have a traditional Jewish Christmas."
Manny,But I risked my life grocery shopping.
Jay,"Save that story for wang fu. Now let's go. Come on, everybody."
Mitchell,"Dad, no."
Jay,"On me! Out! Everybody out! Let's go. Come on, baby girl. Come on, honey."
Luke,What's going on?
Claire,You hate Chinese food.
Jay,"Not bad, huh?"
Cameron,"Jay, Jay, Jay."
Jay,"You wanna hug me, don't you?"
Cameron,I kind of do.
Jay,4 to 5 seconds.
Cameron,45 seconds?
Jay,4 to 5 seconds.
Cameron,"Oh, okay."
Gloria,Family is family. Whether it's the one you start out with...
Mitchell,"Hi, mom!"
Claire,"Hi, mom!"
Mitchell,"Merry Christmas! So, um, tell us everything about the new boyfriend."
Claire,"Oh, yeah."
Mitchell,Don't leave anything out.
Claire,You can leave some things out.
Gloria,The one that you end up with... Or the family that you gain along the way... Which makes every day december 16th.
Phil,"Hey, Jay, um, I'm sorry about the baseball card. I- I did get you a- a backup gift. It's-it's nothing. I picked it up when we stopped for gas."
Jay,Dog antlers.
Phil,"I know. You got us snow, and I got you dog antlers."
Jay,I love these.
Phil,I thought you might.
Jay,"Honey, look. Come here. How cute is that? Where's my camera? Gloria, you gotta see this! Casta, Gloria!"
Phil,Dog antlers...
Cameron,He loves dog antlers.
Phil,"Oh, no! Okay! I am so sorry."
Phil,Great. Kids are getting so big. Haley's about to go off...
Phil,...to college.
Phil,"Clearly. I look at Clint Eastwood or Chuck Norris and I think, there's no reason I can't stay tough like.. Oh, tickles! But... Aw!"
Phil,No. Not r... ow. What?
Phil,Yeah.
Phil,What kind of tests?
Phil,Okay.
Phil,"Well, interest rates are low, so it's a great time to be a buyer, but if you're a seller, you really have to..."
Phil,"True, but a quality property is still a quality..."
Phil,"Oh. Right. Well, let's dim the lights, crank up the Norah Jones, and get this over with."
Alex,"Oh, hey. How'd it go?"
Cameron,Amazing. I was so proud of him.
Mitchell,"Oh, thanks, honey. I'm kind of proud of me, too. Look at what they gave me."
Alex,"""California State Bar Association Award, for Distinguished Service in The Field of Environmental Law."""
Cameron,"You should have seen it. They called his name, he went up on stage, he gave a great speech. It was humble, inspirational, with a touch of dry humor at the end. It was very Colin Firth."
Mitchell,"Oh, Cam, thank you, But... it's hardly an Oscar."
Mitchell,"In the environmental law community, it kinda is an Oscar."
Cameron,So how was Lily? I hope you weren't too bored.
Alex,"Oh, please, are you kidding me? I love talking to her. She knows more words than Haley."
Cameron,"Oh, that looks great up there! How impressed are you with your uncle right now?"
Alex,So impressed.
Alex,"I didn't wanna ruin their moment by telling them how many awards I've gotten, but let's just say I don't get out of bed for a trophy that size."
Jay,"Darn it! I'm trying to send an e-mail. This mouse keeps sticking. Pretty big reaction. It's 10 bucks, tops."
Gloria,"You just reminded me about my dream last night. I was in the middle of a meadow, coming down a staircase, then suddenly a black mouse showed up. He stopped, stared at me in the eyes, and opened his little mouth."
Jay,What did it say?
Gloria,"What did he say, Jay? He was a mouse. They don't know how to talk."
Jay,Now you're playing logic police? You're standing on a staircase in a meadow?
Gloria,"In my country, when somebody dreams about a black mouse, it means that something bad is going to happen!"
Jay,"Ah, don't worry about it. I dreamt about a lucky blue cow. We're good to go."
Manny,"Hey, Jay, this is what I'm wearing for golfing tomorrow. Wanted to give you a heads up in case there's some overlap."
Jay,What are you going for here?
Manny,"Matt Damon in ""Bagger Vance."" You didn't get that?"
Gloria,I did. I think you look just like him.
Manny,"It's the whole reason I asked you to teach me to golf. Any sport where you can wear this, I'm in."
Gloria,Who is that? It's 10:00 at night.
Manny,I'll get it.
Jay,"Hold on, Gatsby."
Manny,Dad!
Jay,There's your black mouse.
Gloria,"Hola, Javier, what are you doing in town?"
Jay,You're staying a week? Make that go away.
Manny,That's so cool!
Jay,"Actually, Manny and I have plans to play golf tomorrow."
Manny,"Yeah, can we all go?"
Gloria,"Ay, no, baby, I can't. I promised Haley that I was gonna help her with her Spanish. But Jay's going to go with you."
Jay,What?
Gloria,"I'm not gonna let Manny take off with Javier by himself. Once, when Manny was 6, Javier took him to the petting zoo, which later, I found out that was the name of the stripper club. A real petting zoo would have been cleaner."
Jay,But I was looking forward to playing...
Gloria,You're going.
Mitchell,Would you look at that?
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, you know, I never saw us as trophy on the mantle people, but yours looked so gosh darned good up there, I figured, why not be proud of what we've done?"
Mitchell,"Uh, ""First Place, Bass Catchers Spring Fish-Off, Missouri North Division."""
Cameron,2-day total of 10 smallmouth bass weighing 34.24 pounds with a 4 1/2-pound kicker.
Mitchell,So you beat all the other boys aged 12 through 17?
Cameron,"Sure did. Look at our trophies up there. We're a couple of winners, aren't we?"
Mitchell,Are we?
Phil,Claire? Where are all my razor blades?
Claire,They're not in that box?
Phil,No.
Claire,"Well, I guess they're gone."
Phil,They can't be gone.
Phil,"In my 20s, I went on a game show and won a lifetime supply of razor blades."
Phil,3.14159.
Phil,"Banana cream. Well, you got me there, Chip."
Phil,"What?! Two blades in one razor? Man, it'll never get better than that!"
Claire,You must have used them all up.
Phil,"They said ""a lifetime supply."""
Claire,"Honey, you got 15 years of free razor blades. Put that in the ""Win"" column and move on."
Luke,"Mom, is it okay if my friend Walt comes over to play ""Rebel Fighters 3""?"
Claire,"Honey, don't you think it is a little weird that one of your best friends is an eighty-year-old man?"
Luke,"No, it makes it more fun, because he was in a real war. He says cool things like ""See you in hell, Klaus."" I don't even know what that means. Oh, hey, dad, some doctor called for you."
Phil,Dr. Sendroff?
Luke,"Yeah, that's it. You were in the shower."
Phil,What did he say?
Luke,"He wants you to call him right away. Oh, well. See you in hell, Klaus."
Claire,What's wrong?
Phil,"I don't know. He ran a few tests on me yesterday. He said he'll call if something was wrong. And now he's calling. Hi, this is Phil Dunphy. I'm returning Dr. Sendroff's call. Are you serious?"
Claire,What?
Phil,"He's on a flight to London. Um, is there any way I can reach him, or...uh, uh, someone else I can talk to? Okay. Fine. Please just tell him it's urgent. Thank you. Oh, boy."
Claire,"Honey, I am sure it's nothing."
Phil,"Claire, I'm tender under my arm."
Claire,Maybe Luke hit you with his broomstick when you guys were playing Quidditch.
Phil,"I'm way too fast, he never touched me."
Claire,I can assure you you are perfectly fine.
Phil,"That's very comforting, coming from a marketing major at a party school."
Jay,"I like the number 4 horse. He loves this track, his dad won the Preakness, last three finishes were in the money."
Manny,I like Miranda's Miracle.
Jay,Why?
Manny,"There's this girl Miranda in my class, and she is really pretty. If she likes me back, it will be a miracle. Would you bet $2 on that one for me, Jay?"
Jay,"Sure, but you are throwing your money away."
Jay,"Number 7... Well, he's carrying 3 extra pounds, and he hates the distance."
Jay,Tells ya?
Jay,No need for the qualifier.
Manny,Maybe I should bet on your horse.
Jay,"Are you kidding me? These aren't just words. They give you all this information, so you can make an informed decision and beat the odds."
Manny,$2 on my hometown. You really think he's going to win?
Jay,Or part of a horse.
Cameron,"Oh, hey, Alex called. She left her cell phone here. She's gonna come back and get it."
Mitchell,"Cam, did you do something to your fish trophy?"
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, I forgot about this fun middle part. You see, now it looks like a fish jumping out of the water."
Mitchell,"Yeah, right over mine."
Cameron,"Do I sense something, Mitch? You know, just because mine's a little taller than yours, doesn't make yours any less important."
Mitchell,"Oh, no. That's not what I was feeling, not even a little bit."
Cameron,"Oh, my god. You don't like that I put my trophy up."
Mitchell,"I just think it's a little weird that immediately after I win a trophy, You feel the need to dig this thing up and plop it down next to mine."
Cameron,"I'll have you know that I want to display this for quite some time. But I put it in box in the garage with all my other awards... Yes, award-z... Out of courtesy to a sadly award-less you."
Mitchell,"It looks ridiculous. Mine is a distinguished professional award given to me by my peers, and yours was given to you on a pier."
Cameron,"Okay, well, for your information, when I won this, it was a very big deal. I cut a ribbon at the grocery store and signed autographs. ""Best fishes, Cameron Tucker"""
Mitchell,"Oh, you know what? I just remembered! Mine comes with a really fun pedestal, too! Oh! Look at that! Oh, and proper hierarchy is restored. Unless you suddenly remember that your fish came with a top hat."
Cameron,"Okay. Well, you know what? I'm gonna go get Lily from her party and go to the park."
Mitchell,OK.
Cameron,"This award has changed you, Mitchell. You may be flying high now, but pretty soon, you're gonna be free falling, Tom Petty... Because you're petty. Tom Petty. Hmm? Get it?"
Mitchell,About three sentences ago.
Gloria,"Hola, Haley."
Haley,"Hi, Gloria. Thanks for coming over."
Gloria,"En español, por favor."
Haley,"Uh, hola, Gloria. Gracias for coming over."
Gloria,"No, the whole thing."
Haley,I don't know the whole thing. Why do I even need to learn Spanish? I live in california. I'm never gonna use it.
Gloria,"That's the problem with Americans. They expect all of us to know their language, but they don't even make the effort to learn ours."
Luke,Ha. So wrong.
Phil,"Oh, hey, Gloria."
Gloria,"Hi, Phil. How are you?"
Phil,I wish I knew.
Gloria,Why? What's wrong?
Phil,"Uh, I don't wanna bum you out. My doctor did some tests and said he'd call if something was wrong, and he called this morning."
Gloria,And what did he say?
Phil,I don't know. I missed the call. Now I can't reach him.
Gloria,The black mouse.
Phil,What?
Gloria,"In my dream. It was a bad omen. But probably not for you. The staircase. No, no, no. You're fine. You're fine."
Phil,"Am I? Get this... 15 years ago, I won a lifetime supply of razor blades. They ran out... today. What's with the spitting? Are you warding off death?"
Gloria,No. When I did I think I suck in a little bug.
Manny,"$16 for the first race, $10 from the second race, plus $34... $60? You're a genius, dad."
Manny,I love gambling! It's so easy!
Jay,It's not easy.
Manny,"Oh, burn, Jay! I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. This is all so heady."
Jay,$50 on little bacon to win.
Manny,"Yeah, ooh-ee."
Jay,What? What ooh-ee?
Manny,"I think I saw it, too."
Jay,You didn't see anything. This horse is a heavy favorite. The rest of the pack couldn't beat a merry-go-round. I'm sticking with Little Bacon.
Manny,"It's your funeral. Who are we going with, dad?"
Jay,"Oh, gee. You know what? Make it $300."
Manny,"Oh, my."
Jay,"I'm telling you, kid, this is the one. And you know how I know? 'Cause it said, ""pfft."""
Gloria,"""Maria bought a beautiful white dress for her wedding."""
Haley,"Um, Maria compró un hermoso vestido blanco para su... I-I'm sorry. I cannot concentrate with him here. What are you doing?"
Phil,"Just taking it all in. You're a beautiful, intelligent woman... And don't you ever forget it."
Haley,"Wow, he is so weird sometimes."
Gloria,"No, he's not weird! He's a saint! And you will miss him when he's gone... One day."
Alex,"Hey, Uncle Mitchell."
Mitchell,"Your, uh, phone's on the table."
Alex,What's that?
Mitchell,"Oh, Cam's old fishing trophy. Yeah, when I woke up this morning, that's where I found it."
Alex,Right after you got yours?
Mitchell,Thank you!
Alex,"Oh, my god. Welcome to my world. Last week, I got this beautiful plaque from the debate team for outstanding achievement, and what did my mom do? She found one of Luke's ""participant"" ribbons and a certificate Haley got for showing up somewhere on time, and put all three of them together on the same shelf! It's, like, so unfair!"
Mitchell,"I was so glad I talked to Alex, because she agreed with every single thing I was feeling... which made me realize that I was acting like a 14-year-old girl."
Luke,Sorry. I can't concentrate with my dad staring at me.
Phil,I just love you so much.
Luke,"Ugh. Oh, great, now I'm dead. I'm going to the bathroom."
Phil,"Hey, Walt. You ever think about death?"
Phil,I got a call from the doctor. There's a 60% chance I'm gonna die.
Claire,"Phil, you've gotta let this go."
Phil,"I'm sorry, Claire. I don't know how to react when I find out there's a 70% chance I'm gonna die."
Claire,"Honey, listen to me. You're gonna be fine."
Phil,You really think so?
Claire,I know so.
Phil,"Claire's my rock. You know when you're on a plane and there's turbulence, you look at the flight attendants, and if they're still smiling and serving drinks, you know everything's gonna be okay? That's Claire. I could also picture her as a cop."
Jay,Go Little Bacon. Go Little Bacon. You got this! You got this! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Jay,"Yes! I knew it! You see that, Manny? Dumb luck always runs out. But if you live in the real world, and you use your head, not have it in the clouds like Dr. Dolittle there, you'll do okay."
Manny,"Guess we should have listened to Jay on this one, dad."
Jay,"You got that right. You should have listened to Jay. And I'll tell you something else. You can't look in a horse's eyes and tell there's something wrong. You can't even look in their eyes at the same time... One's here and one's here! Come on. Let's go to the window, kid. I may need some help carrying my winnings."
Manny,"Jay, look."
Jay,Inquiry.
Manny,What's that?
Jay,Possible infraction. Usually it's nothing. I'm sure...
Jay,What?!
Manny,"Tough break, Jay. Here... Little something for gas."
Mitchell,"Cam was right. I-I was being petty. So I found his box of old trophies and I decided to surprise him by having them on the mantle when he got home. Well, I was the one who was surprised. I had no idea how many trophies he had... First place, and all of them for different things. Music, football, art show, science fair, a chili cook-off. A lifetime of accolades hidden away just so I wouldn't feel bad."
Mitchell,"Aah! That's a mouse! That's a mou... oh! Ew! Oh! Disgusting! Oh, no! No, cam, I-I was gonna make a big display!"
Cameron,I believe you have.
Mitchell,"No, no, Cam! There was a... Oh! Gross!"
Manny,"No, it's okay. I got it."
Jay,Not at all.
Jay,You really wanna know? I'll tell you.
Jay,"All right, listen, hang on. I'm sorry I went after you like that in front of Manny. That was wrong."
Jay,"I don't owe this guy anything. He stops by a couple of times a year to see his kid. It used to be a relief, gave me a nice break. But now Manny and I, we got our own thing. Look, I know I'm not his dad... Maybe I don't like the reminder."
Mitchell,"Oh! Oh, my gosh!"
Claire,"Hey, what's up? What?"
Mitchell,We came as soon as we heard.
Claire,Heard what?
Mitchell,We heard Phil got bad news from the doctor.
Claire,Who told you that?
Mitchell,Gloria!
Gloria,"No, I didn't say that he got bad news... I said that he was getting bad news."
Claire,You don't know that he's getting bad news.
Gloria,I saw a black mouse.
Mitchell,I saw a black mouse.
Cameron,So he says.
Claire,Okay. You guys...
Gloria,"Oh, this is worse than I thought!"
Claire,"No, it's not. Listen to me. Listen. Phil is fine. As a matter of fact, you should go before he even knows you're here."
Gloria,"No, no. We're staying."
Mitchell,We're staying.
Gloria,Did you bring the coffee cake?
Jay,He carried it in from the car. I paid for it.
Claire,Thank you. Who is this?
Cameron,"Who, indeed?"
Gloria,Javier! The body is not even cold yet!
Claire,The body is upstairs watching basketball. He is fine.
Jay,Gloria said he was sick.
Claire,"No. He went to the doctor, he had some tests. The doctor called. That's it."
Gloria,Plus today he run out of his lifetime supply of razors.
Manny,That's a sign.
Jay,This is a lot of hocus-pocus! I can't believe I bought a coffee cake over this!
Mitchell,"Wait, wait, wait, no, no. I'm confused. What did the doctor say exactly?"
Claire,I don't know. We missed his call this morning.
Jay,The doctor called on Saturday?
Claire,Yeah. So?
Jay,Nothing.
Claire,Not nothing. Not nothing. What?
Jay,"Well, it's just that, uh, Doctors don't usually call on Saturday with good news."
Claire,"But they could call... I mean, he could call with anything. Do you think he's sick..."
Phil,What's... what's going on?
Claire,Nothing. Nothing. Everybody just came by for absolutely no reason at all.
Phil,You look worried.
Claire,I'm not worried.
Phil,"Oh, god. The plane's in trouble. You put away the drink cart and you're strapping in."
Jay,"You're gonna be fine, kid!"
Mitchell,You are gonna be great!
Phil,"Stop, please! You're freaking me out."
Phil,I don't know! There's stil a 5% chance I'll make it! It's Dr. Sendroff.
Claire,Okay. Okay.
Phil,"Guys, I don't know what's on the other end of this phone call... But whatever happens, I just want you to know, you've already given me a lifetime supply of happiness. I remember once as a child..."
Claire,Do it! Dr. Sendroff? What's the word? Are you serious?
Claire,What?
Phil,That's it?
Gloria,What is it?!
Phil,H-hold on one second. He's calling about a real estate listing. I'm fine.
Gloria,"Ay, no."
Phil,"Yesterday, you said you'd call if something was wrong. Then you called, then you disappeared. That is the most irresponsible, unprofessional thing I've ever heard of in my entire life! And do you have anyone to represent you in the sale of your current house?"
Mitchell,Stop staring.
Phil,"Well, Chip, I'm married to a great lady... Hi, Claire! And I have a baby girl. Um, I'm a real estate agent, and I enjoy playing checkers."
Phil,"Both Chinese and American. And, uh, I am a fan of hip-hop."
Phil,Though I try to stay neutral in the whole east coast/west coast thang.
Phil,"One quick thing... Shout out to my, uh, college buddy Ling, who built his own helicopter and is taking his first flight today, and, uh, I also wanna wish a happy anniversary to my in-laws Jay and Dede Pritchett. Your eternal love is an inspiration to us all."
Phil,So the five keys to investing wisely in a down real estate market are... Keeep your cool... Keeep informed... Legwork.
Phil,"I recently became a partner in a new agency, so I put together a seminar to recruit first-time home buyers. I want to give 'em a step-by-step description of exactly what I can do for them. Am I worried that they might write it all down and just do it themselves? Quite frankly, I hadn't thought about it until just now."
Haley,Do I really have to go to this thing?
Phil,Yes. You're a big part of today. You're my support staff.
Haley,Then why am I not getting paid?
Claire,That is a good question. And I think I'm gonna text you the answer on that cell phone we pay for.
Phil,"Honey, do you wanna practice your part again?"
Claire,"Uh, no. It's just one question. I think I got it."
Phil,"Yeah, but it's the most important question because it launches me into my big finish."
Claire,Yes.
Phil,"That way, people leave excited."
Haley,"Oh, I think people will be excited to leave."
Claire,Luke... Why?
Luke,I'm sorry. It's for school. I have to design a container that'll protect an egg in a 1-story drop.
Claire,"Yeah, so, um, you thought you would go with an egg carton?"
Luke,What if the best idea was under my nose the whole time?
Claire,You're gonna need to come down and clean this up now.
Luke,Ugh! I wouldn't have to do any of this if Alex would just let me use hers from when she took the class.
Alex,Never. That design is my intellectual property. I think it has applications for unmanned space flight.
Haley,Keep talking like that and you'll go through life unmanned.
Alex,Funny.
Claire,"Girls. Luke, honey, listen to me. You're gonna need to do this project on your own. And you can do it. Just... really think."
Luke,I've got it! What if I'm the container?
Claire,"There's a thought. You could be... No, Luke! Luke!"
Gloria,"Okay, si, te quiero. Mwah, mwah, mwah!"
Manny,"I understood ""crazy old witch,"" ""go kill yourself,"" then ""I love you."""
Jay,"I'll never get this, how you all yell at each other."
Gloria,That's how you know that your family loves you... when they feel free to scream at you.
Jay,"Oh, I guess I owe my ex-wife an apology. Apparently, she was nuts about me."
Manny,Darn it!
Jay,Try the next one over a frying pan. I could use some breakfast.
Manny,This is so frustrating.
Jay,At least you're getting your hands dirty for a change.
Manny,It is a nice break from the life of the mind I usually live.
Jay,That's the spirit.
Manny,Plus it's a metaphor for the human condition. Aren't we al just fragile eggs hiding behind bubble wrap and bravado?
Jay,And we're back.
Gloria,"Well, I'm sure that your egg-droppy thing is going to be the best in the class."
Manny,Hmm. Except for Luke's.
Gloria,"Really? Our Luke? But isn't he, like, a little, like..."
Manny,"I bet Claire's gonna help him, just like she did with his self-portrait for art class. There was life in those eyes. It was haunting."
Jay,"Tell you what. I'm gonna nip this in the bud. You deserve a fighting chance. Hey, I'm calling about that, uh, egg project the boys are doing. Parents aren't supposed to help out on that, right?"
Claire,Why would the parents be helping?
Jay,"Why do they cut grapes for 8-year-olds? I figure if you can eat a chicken finger, you can tear your way through a grape."
Claire,"Again, dad?"
Jay,"Oh, I'm sorry, it just... bugs me, is all. The point is, I'm not helping, and I hope no one else is helping, either."
Claire,"Okay, dad. Thanks for the heads-up. Love you. Bye-bye. Well, my dad is doing Manny's project for him."
Phil,He called to tell you that?
Claire,"Oh, no. He called to tell me that he wasn't, which is exactly what you say when you are, but you don't want anybody to suspect it."
Phil,Really?
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,What would you say if you had issues with your father?
Phil,Claire and Jay are incredibly competitive.
Gloria,"Tennis games, card games, everything. Who knows why?"
Mitchell,"Claire is the son that my dad never had. I mean, he just wanted someone to throw a ball in the backyard. I did once, but... he did not attend."
Claire,Looks like fun.
Luke,"It was, but now it's hard."
Claire,"Oh, I'm sure you're gonna do great, buddy... Eee..."
Phil,Claire?
Claire,"Uh, I am just showing interest in our son's project, which any parent would... Think! Think... to do. Thinking... I am, that maybe I should stay here in case Luke has any questions. Do you think you can find somebody else to help you with your seminar?"
Phil,I don't know. That's a little last-minute. You're kind of irreplaceable.
Claire,"Well, I mean, it's just one question, and the seminar isn't for a few hours..."
Phil,"Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, Gloria? Quick favor."
Gloria,Okay. See you there. Bye-bye.
Jay,What was that?
Gloria,Phil. He needs help with a seminar that he's giving.
Jay,Why can't Claire help him?
Gloria,He didn't say.
Jay,I'll tell you why... because she's knee-deep in Luke's egg drop project.
Gloria,She said that she was not going to help.
Jay,That's exactly what I would say to me if I was helping my kid and didn't want me to know.
Gloria,Why would you be talking to you?
Jay,I'm just saying it's unfair to Manny. The kid doesn't stand a chance on his own. I'm tagging in here.
Gloria,"Jay, he doesn't need you to baby him."
Jay,"I'm just gonna give him a few tips. Kid, get yourself a snack."
Gloria,"Okay, I'll cut him some grapes."
Jay,Damn it!
Gloria,"Not like that, Jay. Like this. Look."
Jay,"It just irritates me, you know what I mean?"
Mitchell,We're meeting with prospective birth mothers.
Cameron,"We've had a few of these meetings, and they're very nerve-racking. You want to look good, you want to make a good first impression... kind of like a first date."
Mitchell,"Actually, it's... it's the opposite of a first date. You don't wanna have sex, but you do want a baby."
Cameron,"Oh, not all the time. She just happens to love my tuna salad. Dolphin safe, of course."
Mitchell,"Well, I bet the dolphins do."
Cameron,Mm.
Mitchell,"Well... A dolphin's actually a mammal, so..."
Mitchell,"More like tomato, cow."
Cameron,"Mitchell, can you help me with the scones in the kitchen?"
Mitchell,Okay.
Cameron,"Excuse us. Okay, this is not really about the scones."
Mitchell,"Oh, really? You didn't need help carrying six scones?"
Cameron,"No, this is about your need to correct everyone's every little mistake."
Mitchell,I am sorry. I thought that she could use a basic biology lesson.
Cameron,"Well, let me give you a basic biology lesson... you and I can't make a baby. So if she points to a lamp and calls it ""Uncle George,"" what are you gonna say?"
Mitchell,"""Pleased to meet you, Uncle George."""
Cameron,"Very good. Now let's get out there, smile, nod, and get ourselves a baby."
Mitchell,Okay.
Phil,"And those are your five keys. Now if there are no more questions... Ah, yes, the lovely home buyer right here on the edge of her seat."
Gloria,"I was wondering... I was wondering, is there a sixth key?"
Phil,"As a matter of fact, there is. We'll work on that. It's the key to the new home you've purchased below market thanks to Woosnum, Keneally, and Dunphy."
Gloria,Bravo!
Phil,"Fire the confetti cannon, drop the banner, autographs, autographs, autographs, and we're done."
Haley,"We still have, like, an hour left. Can I go shopping?"
Phil,"No. I-I have vocal exercises to do, and I need you to do a sound check for me."
Gloria,"Ay, I was hoping we could go to my hair salon. It's nearby. I didn't have time to finish my hair this morning."
Phil,Really? That just happens?
Haley,"Ooh, and I can get my nails done. Is it okay?"
Phil,"Okay. Sure. Oh, oh! Could one of you guys stick this under a chair on your way out? One of the lucky attendees is going home with a brand-new mouse pad. Wait, wait, wait, wait! I don't wanna see which chair. I wanna be blown away like everyone else."
Cameron,"Oh, yes. This is wonderful for conversation."
Mitchell,"Yes, this is nice. It gives the room a nice flow, which I'm really liking."
Mitchell,Not at all. It's... it's just down the hall. Just be warned... there's some furniture in there that kind of likes where it is!
Cameron,"Okay, I know it's killing you to do this whole song and dance, but I think it's going great."
Mitchell,"Cam, there's a limit, okay? We already promised her that we would show her son all 52 states."
Cameron,"Oh, yes. That's mine."
Cameron,"Oh, well, you're preaching to the choir. Literally. I've sung in several."
Mitchell,"Yeah, we sing to Lily... All of the time. Mm."
Cameron,"Oh, well, that's very sweet."
Cameron,Okay.
Mitchell,Okay. Now we are actually doing a song and dance.
Cameron,"Okay, well, look at it this way... we're not only adopting a baby, we're saving it from a life spent searching for east Dakota."
Mitchell,"Oh, God."
Cameron,This is actually nice.
Mitchell,This is actually very nice to lean on.
Luke,Ugh! It broke again.
Claire,"Mm. Yes, I saw. We'll just need to double up on the cotton."
Alex,"Here, let me save you a step."
Claire,Alex!
Jay,"Knock, knock!"
Claire,Dad! Hey! What are you doing here?
Jay,"Manny needs that soldering iron I lent to Phil. One of the screws on his project keeps coming loose. Other than that, it's flawless. Huh. His latest test run, he dropped it off the roof, he walked downstairs, it hadn't landed yet."
Jay,I had nothing. I had to get in Claire's head. Sometimes the best thing to do in race to the top... is grease the pole behind you.
Claire,Wow. So Manny's still working? Luke finished a couple hours ago.
Jay,Is that why all these eggs are on the floor?
Claire,"Oh, well, you know, after so many landed safely, we thought we should test 'em, make sure we weren't working with a super strong batch."
Jay,Sounds like you knocked it out of the park.
Claire,"Oh, yeah, definitely. We did. Um, so dad, if I find out what Phil did with that soldering iron, I'll run it over."
Jay,"Great. 'Cause, uh, we're gonna test it later today at the school."
Claire,"Fun. Maybe we'll meet you. We can come anytime, right? 'Cause we don't have a... a spring problem."
Jay,Around five?
Claire,Perfect.
Mitchell,Okay. Bear with us. We're a little rusty.
Cameron,"Yes, and please put all cell phones on vibrate."
Cameron,Don't go breaking my heart
Mitchell,I couldn't if I tried
Cameron,"Honey, if I get restless"
Mitchell,"Baby, you're not that kind?"
Mitchell,"Nobody knows, When I was down..."
Cameron,...I was your clown. I really am a clown.
Cameron,So don't go breaking my heart
Mitchell,"I won't go breaking your heart, Don't go breaking my..."
Cameron,"Yeah. Oh... Yes, yes, I am."
Cameron,"Well, I think he was following my lead. You know, a good leader can make all the difference."
Mitchell,Thank you.
Cameron,Yes. Thank you for your opinion.
Gloria,"Faster! Faster! We're going to be late to your father. Why did you have to do your toes, too?"
Haley,"Well, there's this really cute boy at school who's kinda into my feet."
Gloria,Be careful. That can get really creepy fast. Ay. Where is the car? I parked it here!
Haley,It's a tow zone.
Gloria,"Somebody just put that there, because that wasn't here when I parked!"
Haley,It looks pretty old to me.
Gloria,"Haley, don't lie. That was not here!"
Phil,"Ladies and gentlemen... Get ready for one of the giants of residential real estate... A salesman's salesman... Where are you guys? I've been calling you! A realtor's realtor... You were supposed to do my intro. Now I have to. 2-time nonconsecutive winner of the realtor of the year award... Just get back here by the end. Future investors, stop making excuses! And start... making your dreams come true! Ladies and gentlemen, Phil Dunphy! Hey! How are you? Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it. Welcome."
Gloria,Taxi! You see? They don't stop because I'm Latina.
Haley,Or because that was just a yellow car. My dad is gonna freak out. You have to take the blame for this.
Gloria,Why me?
Haley,"Oh, because he'll never get mad at you. He totally puts you on a pedestal."
Gloria,That's not true.
Haley,"Yeah, it is. Let me just call the cab company."
Gloria,Taxi!
Phil,"It's not rocket science, people, it's just a little red card. Okay. I guess nobody needs a mouse pad."
Claire,How's my favorite kid doing?
Alex,Favorite?
Claire,"Yeah, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But you know what? We do. And the good news is, it's you."
Alex,I'm not giving you my design.
Claire,Who said anything about giving? We can work out an arrangement.
Alex,It's cheating.
Claire,What do you want? Money? I got a little something set aside.
Alex,"Okay. I shouldn't even be giving you this hint, but... first get a mirror."
Claire,A mirror?
Alex,"Then you're gonna look in it, and you're gonna see a crazy woman. She needs your help."
Claire,"You know, I made the egg that made you, that made that project, so in a lot of ways, that design is already mine! Oh, you're fine."
Phil,Are you sure that there are no more questions? No more questions? Yes! If we could just get that over to the mustachioed gentleman.
Phil,"Oh, hey, I think we're all tired of that sound. Let me just come to you. I bet I know what your question is. You're probably wondering if there's sixth key."
Phil,"If it works for both parties, it's a great way to expedite the deal. But back to your first question about this mysterious sixth key."
Phil,"The sixth key is the key to the new home that you purchased below market using the simple principles that you learned here today... But not so simple that you don't still need the professional services of Woosnum, Keneally... and Dunphy! Thank you for coming. Son of a..."
Mitchell,"So, is there anything you want to know about us?"
Mitchell,Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Mitchell,"Aah! Oh, gosh! Oh, I know, I know, you're not saying anything!"
Cameron,But what you're not saying is wonderful!
Mitchell,"Um, all right. I'm gonna get some sparkling cider? Yes, yes. Okay, okay."
Cameron,"It wouldn't be a celebration without cider or a celebratory song. But this time, I want you to sit right here. So have a seat here. Let's just get this mop out of the way there."
Cameron,"If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooh, ooh, ooh, no, baby, please don't go. Ooh, ooh, ooh, no, I just want you to stay."
Cameron,"Yes, she was upset, but on a positive note, what I take from this experience is, I can sing."
Mitchell,"Uh, what we didn't take away from the experience is a baby, because she decided to keep it."
Gloria,Ay. No. Did we missed everything?
Phil,Yeah. They cleared out of here pretty fast.
Haley,Bummer.
Phil,"More than a bummer, Haley. This was really important to me, and you blew it."
Gloria,"Ay, no, Phil, it was my fault."
Phil,It was not her fault. Okay. What's done is done. Can you take the brochures out to the car?
Haley,Wow. It's still full.
Phil,"Yeah, it is."
Gloria,So it was not very good?
Phil,Um... no. I kind of need to sweep here.
Gloria,"Okay. But... but I'm so sorry, Phil."
Phil,It's okay.
Gloria,"No, it's not okay. We came late and we ruined your whole presentation."
Phil,These things happen.
Gloria,"Yeah, it happens and people get angry."
Phil,"Gloria, it's fine."
Gloria,"No, it's not fine! I'm trying to have a real conversation, and all you do is put me on a pedestal!"
Phil,Wait a minute. You're mad at me?
Gloria,"Yes, because that's not how family's supposed to treat each other!"
Phil,"You know how family's supposed to treat each other? They're supposed to actually think about each other! I asked you to do one thing... and you were too selfish and irresponsible to come through for me on a day that, believe it or not, was really important to me! Oh, my God. You're crying. I'm so sorry."
Gloria,No! That's what I want! You yell at me because you love me!
Phil,"Well, you made me mad."
Gloria,And you should be.
Phil,"Well, I'm not anymore."
Gloria,"Don't treat me like that, Phil."
Phil,Because now I'm furious!
Gloria,"Ay, mi familia! Si."
Phil,"Oh, how do you do that? It makes me so... Mad."
Claire,That's a pretty nice piece of handiwork for a 13-year-old.
Jay,"Yeah, Luke did pretty good, too, for a kid who still needs help getting out of his backpack."
Claire,Still your grandson.
Jay,Felt bad when I said it.
Claire,"Okay, let's do this. Watch out, kids! They're coming down! One, two, three. How'd we do?"
Alex,Both eggs are okay.
Manny,Great. So we both win.
Jay,Unacceptable. We're going up another level.
Claire,"Absolutely. Come on. Third floor. Meet us there, Alex. Let's go."
Manny,Wait. You don't have to do this. The assignment was for a 1-story drop. We both get A's.
Claire,We're doing this.
Manny,I don't like this. The two of them talking up there... they're gonna figure out what we did.
Luke,We did what we had to.
Manny,We're gonna get caught.
Jay,Look at them down there. They're not even paying attention. This is the best part.
Claire,"Actually, Manny looks kind of upset."
Jay,Why would he be? He's about to kick Luke's butt.
Alex,"Oh, knock it off. Luke and Manny had as much to do with this project as they did with the Manhattan project."
Claire,You think that's what's going on? They're upset because we took over for them?
Jay,Maybe.
Claire,"They were supposed to... to learn from this, and... and we ruined it. We should go talk to them."
Jay,Yeah.
Jay,"Boys, we need to talk."
Manny,"Oh, God. Oh, God."
Luke,Just stay frosty.
Claire,"So, uh, we realized a couple things up there, and I think apologies are in order."
Manny,"OK, we admit it. We tricked you into doing our projects for us."
Claire,What?
Luke,This is the first I'm hearing of this.
Manny,"We knew you'd do all the work if you thought you were competing with each other. So I told you I thought Claire was helping Luke, and then you called Claire..."
Claire,"Which got me involved, and..."
Jay,"All right. Here's what's gonna happen... you're gonna get in the car, we're gonna drive home, and you're each gonna do your own projects."
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Luke,Fine.
Claire,"Hmm. Hmm. You know, this is your fault."
Jay,What?
Claire,"The way we compete with each other it's... is sick. It's so sick, two 13- year-olds know how to take advantage of us. And you know what? You made me this way."
Jay,How do you figure that?
Claire,"Dad! You pushed me into sports. You never let me win. You know, that stuff... it does something to a girl."
Jay,"For your information, you came out of the womb like that. I'm not entirely sure there wasn't a twin in there you bumped off."
Claire,"If you saw that in me, why didn't you discourage it?"
Jay,Why would I discourage something that I love?
Claire,Really?
Jay,You kidding? You're a fighter. The thing I love about you is you never give up.
Claire,Dad.
Jay,Even though I clearly designed a superior egg container.
Claire,"Out of your mind, old man."
Jay,Only one way to find out.
Alex,Give up. You're all just playing for second.
Claire,There's something wrong with that one.
Alex,"I'm not wrong. Mom can be crazy, right?"
Haley,Hello?
Alex,"Thank you. At the same time, I feel guilty when I get mad at her."
Haley,I don't think that's weird.
Alex,Just really proud of my project. I don't wanna share it.
Haley,Everybody has their own thing.
Alex,"Thanks, Haley. I know I may sound dorky, but this late-night conversations really mean a lot to me. They're the only time that I feel like I..."
Haley,"OK, Corey, just one picture. Hold on. Ugh, my feet look fat from this angle. Hey, Alex, wake up. I need you to take a picture of my feet."
Gloria,Did you see it?
Mitchell,Does she know?
Phil,This is the last thing she needs today. No!
Phil,"Busy day at the Dunphy compound. We have a wedding tonight, and this afternoon, Claire is debating Duane Bailey in the race for town council. And now the ""weekly saver"" says that some voters find Claire... quote... ""angry and unlikable."" To those voters, I say, ""wait till she sees this."""
Phil,No one can mention it to her. We can't have some unscientific poll shaking Claire's confidence.
Claire,Phil... What poll?
Phil,Too late. She knows.
Mitchell,Who told her?
Phil,"What is this, a witch hunt?"
Claire,"Oh, my God."
Phil,I have to go.
Claire,"Well, I just don't think it's a big deal. I mean, how many people read the ""weekly..."""
Haley,"""Saver""? Claire ! ""Saver,"" anyway?"
Phil,"22,000... ish. My company adver... used to advertise with that newspaper."
Claire,And how am I angry and unlikable?
Alex,Can I take this one?
Phil,I wouldn't.
Haley,You seem angry now.
Claire,"I am angry, at that poll."
Luke,I think it's the yelling. I would tone down the yelling.
Claire,"Honey, I don't yell for no reason."
Luke,"You yelled at my teacher for calling me ""special."""
Claire,"Honey, that was not a compliment."
Phil,"Sweetheart, you're not unlikable."
Claire,Thank you.
Phil,You just seem unlikable.
Claire,Ohh.
Phil,"But if we work on it, it's totally fixable."
Claire,"How? How, Phil? How are we gonna ""work on it""?"
Phil,"First of all, lose the snippy attitude."
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,And I don't know... maybe we could have a mock debate.
Alex,"Oh. Good idea. That way, mom can rehearse her views on the issues."
Phil,"Yeah, and we can point out all the little things she does that turn people off. Like that look. I would lose that look. Spooky, but better."
Mitchell,"All right. Thank you very much. Hey, Lily! Come here, honey! Hi! Do you know what this is?"
Mitchell,Containing?
Cameron,"She doesn't know ""containing."""
Mitchell,"Well, that's how she learns new words, by us using them."
Cameron,"Or, that's how we lower her self-esteem, by bombarding her with confusing vocabulary."
Mitchell,Told you.
Cameron,Okay. It's your dress. It's finally here!
Mitchell,Aah!
Cameron,It's every little girl's dream to be a flower girl in a wedding.
Mitchell,It's Lily's chance to shine.
Cameron,I was a 3-time ring bearer.
Mitchell,It's Lily's chance to shine.
Mitchell,Oh!
Mitchell,"Oh, no, Cam... Cam, she's gonna look like little bo peep."
Cameron,Or little bo cheap. Look at this fabric. It's already pilling.
Mitchell,Maybe it will look better on.
Cameron,You mean turned on?
Mitchell,"No, it does not... Cam! Oh!"
Cameron,"Oh, my gosh. Are we really gonna let her wear this?"
Mitchell,"You know what? If the bride wants to have a tacky wedding, she can have a tacky wedding. Lily will be the bright spot."
Cameron,Literally.
Mitchell,Heard it as soon as I said it.
Jay,"Stella! Where's my good girl? Gloria, is Stella up there?"
Gloria,"No. But I am. Why don't you say ""hello"" to your wife when you come home?"
Jay,"Well, why don't you greet me at the door, wagging your tail? Stella, honey! Where are you? Stella! My baby! Stella, I'm coming! I'm coming! You okay? You okay?"
Gloria,Why are you swimming in your clothes?
Jay,Because I'm self-conscious about my body. Stella fell in the pool.
Manny,"It's my fault. I let her out, and then I got caught up in my couponing."
Jay,Any coupons for swim lessons? 'Cause Stella needs some.
Gloria,"Seriously? Manny you teach to swim by throwing him in the pool, but the dog gets swimming lessons?"
Manny,"I gotta say, it was unpleasant but effective."
Jay,"We have to teach Stella how to swim. Otherwise, she could drown."
Gloria,Why don't you teach her not to jump in the pool?
Jay,"She didn't jump in the pool. She fell in the pool. Why, suddenly, would she jump in the pool when she doesn't know how to swim?"
Gloria,Why does she bark at the vacuum? It's a thing. It is never going to play with you.
Jay,Are you saying that Stella is stupid?
Gloria,Are you covering her ears?
Jay,Let's have a little compassion. She's probably still traumatized from her near-death experience. Again? What's happening?!
Gloria,"Ay, no!"
Alex,"Welcome, candidates. Mrs. Dunphy..."
Claire,Thank you for having me.
Alex,And councilman Bailey.
Phil,"Gosh, thank you so much, Alex. I'm deeply honored to be here, and I remain, as ever, a humble servant to the greatest little town in the greatest darn..."
Luke,Eye-rolling.
Claire,Playful eye rolling.
Alex,"How do we, as voters, know it's playful? I would avoid it."
Claire,Okay. No eye rolling.
Haley,And don't purse your lips like that. It makes you look annoyed.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Luke,And don't touch your face.
Haley,"Yeah, no face touching. Seems nervous."
Claire,Some of this is subjective. What? What now?
Luke,It looks like you're scolding us.
Claire,I will keep my hands at my sides.
Phil,Not on your hips. You're not superman.
Alex,Can we get started?
Claire,We haven't started?
Alex,I've prepared some questions.
Claire,"Oh, goody! Actual questions."
Phil,Honk. Sarcasm.
Claire,Just go.
Alex,"Okay, Mrs. Dunphy, why are you running for local office?"
Claire,"Okay, that's, um, that's good. I... um, I..."
Alex,"Mom, you really shouldn't stutter over a basic question like that. You should at least know why you're running."
Claire,I thought the moderator was supposed to be objective.
Alex,Not if she's the only one in the room who has actual debate experience. Now why are you running?
Claire,I saw the need for a stop sign in...
Phil,Liar!
Claire,Phil!
Phil,I-I just think you should be ready for anything.
Claire,I saw the need for a s... What?
Luke,Sorry. Accidental buzz.
Claire,"I saw the need for a stop sign in my neighborhood, and although I collected the necessary signatures and did the paperwork, I found local government to be entirely unhelpful... when... what?"
Haley,Too long. I'm bored.
Luke,"Yeah, next question. I feel like I'm in school."
Alex,Some say the political system is bogged down by ideological hard-liners unwilling to compromise.
Claire,Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Alex,"How would you respond to that, councilman Bailey?"
Phil,I would like to use my lifeline.
Claire,"I'll take this. If elected, I would consider all perspectives, and I would not ignore opposing viewpoints."
Phil,Helicopter. Just keep going.
Claire,"I would consider all perspectives, and I wouldn't ignore opposing..."
Luke,You suck!
Claire,Luke!
Luke,You have to be ready for hecklers.
Phil,He's right.
Claire,"Okay. I'm doing over. No buzzing. If elected, I... What?"
Phil,Too close to the mic.
Claire,"Phil, it's a hairbrush."
Phil,Okay.
Claire,"If elected, I would consider all opinions and not ignore those of the opposition, as councilman Bailey has done for six terms. What? That was a great answer."
Haley,"Well, I couldn't hear it because you were showing me the bad side of your face."
Claire,"I have a bad side? Yeah, the left."
Phil,No. It's the right.
Haley,"Uh, dad, it's totally the left. I mean, look at it."
Phil,"Sweetheart, why do you think I chose my side of the bed?"
Claire,"Okay! Okay. Thank you. Thank you, family. This has been super-duper helpful."
Haley,"Hands, lips, sarcasm, eye-rolling, wrong side of the face."
Claire,Mm.
Phil,"Oh, yeah. Now I see it. Yep. She's ready."
Cameron,"And it's this, and it's this. Not this, but this."
Mitchell,"Okay. Okay, that's good, Cam."
Cameron,And this.
Mitchell,"Save... let's save some petals for Lily, all right? Okay. Let's do it over here, sweetheart."
Cameron,"Right over here. Okay. There you go. Oh, like you're coming down the aisle!"
Mitchell,Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Cameron,Not too many at once.
Mitchell,"That's good. Okay. You're doing great, Lil."
Cameron,"Oh, she is, isn't she?"
Mitchell,Forget the bride. All the eyes are gonna be on her.
Mitchell,I cannot believe you laughed!
Cameron,I am sorry. But you know I have two weaknesses... children cursing and old people rapping.
Mitchell,"Cam, we have to tell her it's a bad word."
Cameron,"No. That just gives it more power. The less we make of it, the better. Let's just pretend like it never happened."
Mitchell,"Okay. Yeah, maybe it... maybe it didn't. Maybe we... maybe we misheard."
Cameron,"Yeah. Maybe she said ""truck."" Or... or ""duck."" Or ""luck."" She could have said ""yuck."""
Mitchell,"No, honey, if you're hungry, you can have some fruit."
Mitchell,I have two children.
Claire,"Phil? Phil, is this televised?"
Phil,I didn't tell you because I didn't want to make you nervous.
Claire,Great plan. Really good plan. Throw me for a curveball at the last minute.
Alex,"Mom, chill. It's just public access. My debate team's on public access, and the only people who watch me are you guys."
Phil,Yep. All the time.
Claire,So maybe nobody will see this?
Phil,No. We want people to see this. That's how you win elections. That's the whole point.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Luke,"Then mom should do something so crazy and stupid, it goes viral."
Haley,"Mom, please don't go viral."
Claire,"Okay. I'll add that to my list of things not to do... don't touch my face, don't roll my eyes, don't point my fingers, and definitely don't go viral. Do any of you still believe in me?"
Phil,Of course we do. We're on your side.
Luke,The right side. Not the left.
Phil,Let's grab a seat.
Claire,Right. Left.
Alex,"Okay. Mom, just be confident."
Claire,"Mm-hmm? Based on what? I just lost a debate in my living room, and people think I'm unlikable."
Alex,That's just the word men use for powerful women because they feel threatened. So just forget everything else and be proud and powerful.
Claire,How did you get so smart?
Alex,I've always assumed adoption or baby switch.
Claire,Mm.
Alex,Hey. Hey. No kisses! Proud and powerful.
Claire,Sorry.
Alex,And no apologizing.
Claire,Yes! Shut up and get in there!
Alex,That's more like it!
Claire,Uh-huh!
Alex,Yeah!
Claire,"Oh, God."
Jay,"There she is! Go get 'em, Claire."
Claire,Thanks.
Gloria,Don't worry. We're going to cheer for you no matter what you say.
Claire,"Oh, good. More support from my loving family."
Phil,Sarcasm. Why'd you bring Stella?
Manny,She keeps getting out and jumping in the pool. We don't wanna take any chances because she can't swim.
Alex,Then why does she keep jumping in the pool?
Jay,I've been thinking about it. I got a theory. She might be suicidal.
Gloria,What? That's crazy. There's not such thing as doggy suicide.
Gloria,Stella is not suicidal. She's just... estupid.
Jay,You have no idea. This one's been against this little angel from the very beginning.
Gloria,So now this is my fault?
Jay,I think he knows what he's talking about. The man won a puggly.
Jay,We're done here.
Cameron,Do you have any idea what station this is on?
Mitchell,"Here, I'll look online."
Cameron,It's a Webcast? That would have been helpful to know 900 channels ago.
Mitchell,"No, it's on public access or something."
Mitchell,"Okay. Well, first, honey, we need to talk about something. It's about that word you said this morning."
Mitchell,"You know, the one that starts with ""f""?"
Mitchell,No.
Mitchell,No.
Cameron,"If she doesn't remember it, we shouldn't remind her."
Mitchell,"Oh, well, she said it three times."
Mitchell,"Cam, leave the room!"
Cameron,"No. I can do this. Lily, that is a bad word, and you are not allowed to say it ever."
Mitchell,"Okay, well, daddy shouldn't be laughing, and you should never say that word. Do you understand?"
Mitchell,"Okay. This is not a game, all right? If you say that word one more time, I'm gonna take away all your toys! I'm serious! She knows I'm not serious."
Cameron,What about the wedding? What if she says it there? She's like a ticking time bomb!
Mitchell,"Well, what are we gonna do, cancel?"
Cameron,"Yes. Maybe we just call and say, ""we're not going to any more weddings until the gays can get married."""
Mitchell,"Oh, so now we're political? We leave town on gay pride weekend because we don't like the traffic."
Claire,"26-12B has to do with noise pollution... something, sir, that you are guilty of right now."
Phil,"Oh, no she di'int!"
Alex,"Go, mom!"
Phil,Look at her eyes.
Luke,I know. They're a little too close together. It's been bugging me for years.
Phil,"No, she's in the zone. She's ready for anything."
Claire,I'm sorry? I'm not sorry. What?
Jay,"Oh, jeez."
Claire,That's not true.
Claire,"That is technically true, but in all fairness, it was Valentine's day."
Cameron,This is my new favorite show.
Mitchell,Shh!
Claire,"No, sir, he was looking for me, his wife, and he walked into the wrong room."
Haley,Do you believe this?
Luke,Talking dogs? I'm skeptical.
Alex,Be strong.
Claire,"I am glad that my opponent brought this up, as I feel that it speaks to his character more than mine. I think that we should raise the level of discourse and get back to the issues that the voters really care about."
Claire,I... don't think that's relevant.
Claire,"My personal life has nothing to do with this. Uh... the... my opponent has brought this up to distract from his own record, which shows that in... in six years, he has achieved nothing more than writing one ordinance that allows private parties to have more than eight dogs. Hmm. Hmm."
Jay,"It's like watching the ""hindenburg."""
Gloria,This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen in my life.
Phil,Excuse me!
Jay,Stand by.
Phil,"I am Phil Dunphy, and I am not a pervert. I, like a lot of men in this town, enjoy making love to my wife. I mean, um... I mean with their wives. Not me, them. Look, I should probably just sit down and say nothing. But it's too late. I am standing, and I'm obviously talking, and now you're looking at me, and I feel the need to keep going. First of all... No charges were filed. Everyone had a good laugh... about the situation, not... not about me. Everything's fine down there. Anywho... Where were we?"
Claire,All over YouTube. We went viral.
Phil,Some sick bastard auto-tuned me.
Phil,♪ I... Like a lot of men in this town. I enjoy making love to my wife... wife and I don't know how to stop. I am a pervert. Pervert... per... ♪
Gloria,Jay! Manny! We should have been there already!
Jay,"Gloria, I'm tying my tie!"
Manny,I'm accessorizing!
Gloria,"And I thought I was the woman. The door. Ay! Estella, no! No! Ay! No! No! Estella, don't do it! Don't kill yourself! You are a perfectly fine dog! I don't hate you! Estella, okay, I was a little mean to you, but that's no reason to kill yourself! You are young! You still have so much left to smell! Ay! I am... I go! I'm coming! I'm... Manny! Ay! Come on, Estella!"
Jay,What happened?
Manny,Are you okay?
Gloria,She did it again.
Jay,And you jumped in to save her?
Gloria,"No, Jay! I wanted to take a little swim before going to the wedding!"
Jay,"Get her a towel she's shaking like a leaf. Oh, no, no, I meant... I meant..."
Gloria,"Thank you, Jay. The dog towel for me. For the wife."
Claire,Hi!
Mitchell,"Hey, guys, hi. Hi."
Cameron,"Hey, what's shakin'? What's cooking?"
Claire,"You saw the debate, didn't you?"
Cameron,: The de-what?
Mitchell,"No, that wasn't... that was today? No, no. Was that on today? Oh, I didn't remember."
Claire,You are the worst liars.
Mitchell,It was phenomenal television.
Haley,"Oh, Lily. What a... dress."
Cameron,"Oh, well, you ain't seen nothing yet. How about there... we go."
Haley,Wow. Ohh.
Alex,Yikes.
Luke,She looks like a lite brite.
Claire,"Luke, honey. Lily, sweetie, are you excited to be a flower girl? Yeah? Little bit nervous? Yeah? Why isn't she talking to me? Did she see the debate, too?"
Mitchell,"Nope, she's on verbal lockdown."
Claire,Oh?
Cameron,She's been dropping a certain curse word all day.
Mitchell,"Yeah, so we're just hoping the next one doesn't happen during the wedding."
Phil,"If it does, it'll be the second most embarrassing thing to happen to our family today."
Claire,"Phil, you said it wasn't that bad."
Phil,That was in the car. We're in a church now.
Claire,Honey...
Luke,Somebody turn her off. I think I'm having a seizure.
Phil,"Oh, buddy."
Claire,Oh. Yeah.
Gloria,"Oh, good. I thought that we were going to miss Lily."
Cameron,Ships at sea wouldn't miss Lily. Where have you guys been?
Gloria,I had to jump in the pool to save the stupid dog...
Jay,Who she loves.
Gloria,That I didn't let her down doesn't mean that I love her. I barely got Manny back in the pool after that possum incident.
Manny,"I thought it drowned, but turns out it was just playing possum."
Gloria,"Yes, papi."
Phil,Good job!
Claire,You know what the worst part of today was?
Alex,I imagine it's hard to choose.
Claire,"When everything was melting down, I realized I had an answer to your question why I was running. I wanted to make my family proud, and I did the exact opposite."
Alex,No.
Claire,"No, I did. I totally embarrassed you."
Alex,"No. No, dad embarrassed me. I was proud of you. I think it's cool you're running for local office. I mean, it's totally nerdy, and that's kind of my thing."
Claire,Hmm. Maybe it's kind of our thing.
Phil,"Ah. Some day, I'll walk you down the aisle."
Haley,If you're not in perv’ jail.
Mitchell,Really?
Cameron,"Well, you know I cry at weddings."
Mitchell,"Oh, no."
Cameron,What?
Mitchell,Stop... stop crying.
Cameron,"Well, just because you have ice water in your veins, doesn't mean that..."
Mitchell,"No. No, Lily... No. Lily... He's fine. Daddy's fine. Daddy's not sad."
Cameron,You see? I told you it was funny.
Cameron,Excuse us. Congratulations.
Jay,"Go on, you little motorboat! Look at her go! Where's she going? Oh, jeez, I think she's trying to get herself sucked into the filter. What'd you say to her?"
Gloria,I didn't say anything!
Manny,"Wait a second. Jay, look."
Gloria,See? She was not trying to kill herself. She was just trying to get to the squeaky wiener!
Jay,That must be why she's been jumping in. It must have been there all the time. That's hilarious!
Gloria,"Ay, si! No, it's not!"
Jay,Not now. I'm saying it will be. Later.
Phil,"Oh, I hope Tad likes salmon. It's a bit of a risk serving fish to a first-time diner at Dunphy's. Maybe I should marinate a steak for backup."
Alex,I think someone has a man crush.
Phil,"First of all, I would never date a potential client."
Claire,"That's ""first of all""?"
Phil,"Secondly, I really need this to go well so he makes me his realtor. This guy's flipping properties like they're extras in a kung fu movie."
Alex,So you're just kissing up to this guy for his money?
Phil,"Not just. I really like him. He travels the world doing charity work, rock climbs, flies planes..."
Luke,How does he have time to do all that?
Phil,"Got divorced, and his whole life opened up. Guy's living the dream. His dream. Not my dream. I'm living my dream. You're my dream."
Claire,You can stop.
Haley,I so don't want to do this.
Claire,"Recently, Haley got a little creative on one of her college applications and listed herself as a ""big sister."""
Haley,"Technically, I am a big sister."
Phil,"She capitalized the ""b"" and the ""s."""
Haley,"Which makes sense, 'cause it was."
Phil,So Claire and I suggested...
Haley,Forced.
Phil,That she volunteer for the organization. We couldn't be prouder.
Claire,We could. Little bit.
Mitchell,"Hey, dad? Did you accidentally leave this hilarious book of lawyer jokes in the guest room?"
Jay,I'll tell you if you can answer the following question... What's the difference between a catfish and a lawyer?
Mitchell,I don't know. What?
Jay,"Well, one's a bottom-feeding mud-dweller. The other's a fish."
Mitchell,Zing! Honk!
Cameron,"Okay, everyone, dinner is served! Let's get it!"
Cameron,"Our house is being fumigated, so Jay and Gloria invited us to stay here for a few days. I am very excited to have 72 hours with this one."
Gloria,"We don't get to spend much time together, so I know that we're gonna be like, um..."
Cameron,Fred and Ginger?
Gloria,Who?
Cameron,Movie night!
Jay,It's nosier than usual around here.
Cameron,"Oh, gosh!"
Claire,"Tad, this wine is fantastic."
Claire,Mm.
Phil,"You should come with a warning... ""may be fascinating."" Oh! Excuse me."
Claire,"Oh, oh, gosh! Oh. Ow. Oh, that's, like, the ninth time this screw has popped out."
Phil,"Oh, you know what? I need the angled screwdriver. I left it at the office. Mm. I, um, I keep it there because o... of all my signs. I'll, uh, put up a ""for sale"" sign, and next day, of course, I gotta put up the ""sold"" banner."
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,"Then the next day, same deal... ""for sale ""sold."""
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,"""For sale."" ""Sold."" ""For sale."" ""Sold."""
Claire,You're a great... great salesman.
Phil,"""For sale."" ""Sold."""
Phil,"Hey, listen, um, thank you so much for coming."
Claire,"Yeah, yeah."
Phil,"Oh, great."
Phil,Yeah.
Phil,Let me grab that.
Claire,Bye-bye. Did you see that?
Phil,"A handshake that almost became a hug? Yeah, I saw it. I lived it. I think I'm in."
Claire,"No, honey. He kissed me on the lips."
Phil,Another good sign!
Claire,"It's not a good sign. Sweetie, you don't think that's weird?"
Phil,"Well, the guy's a world traveler. He has a time share in Costa Rica. That's probably how they do it there."
Claire,"I don't know, honey. It felt like he lingered."
Phil,It's a progressive culture. Most of them travel by zip line.
Jay,Biscuits and gravy?
Cameron,"Yep, my grandma Bitsy's secret recipe, given to her by her housekeeper Delilah, who raised her and was her best friend... kind of like ""The Help,"" except Delilah was white, and was actually herself quite the racist. Eat up."
Gloria,Good morning!
Manny,"Hi, mom."
Jay,"Hi, sweetheart."
Gloria,"Ah, where did those come from?"
Manny,"Yeah, I thought amaryllis were out of season."
Cameron,"Oh, I got a guy. You know, I just thought they'd brighten up the house a little bit."
Gloria,"Oh, that was so thoughtful of you."
Gloria,I didn't realize that my house needed brightening up.
Cameron,There she is!
Gloria,Ay! Let me fix your hair!
Cameron,"Oh. Well, isn't that sweet?"
Cameron,I didn't realize her hair was broken.
Mitchell,"Ah! That smells delicious, but nothing for me. I've got an early work lunch."
Jay,Really? I didn't hear an ambulance.
Mitchell,"Yeah, it's funny because it's what I've dedicated my life to."
Cameron,"Oh, is this that meeting with the deejay with the funny name?"
Mitchell,Booker Bell.
Cameron,Booker Bell.
Jay,Booker Bell?
Mitchell,Everybody now!
Jay,Booker Bell was only the greatest deejay in the history of Drive Time Radio.
Mitchell,"Yeah, well, now he has some wetlands that developers want, and we're trying to get him to donate for preservation."
Jay,"When I was on the road selling, I used to listen to Booker all the time. He practically invented the prank phone call."
Mitchell,Okay. Wish me luck.
Cameron,"Good luck, sweetie!"
Jay,"Booker would play a prank, the sucker would be twisting in the wind, and just when you couldn't stand it anymore, he'd say, ""guess who just got their bell rung!"" God, I'd love to meet him."
Cameron,"Oh, they're just going down to Rae's. You should pop down. I'm sure he'd love to meet a fan."
Jay,"I don't know. I met Boz Scaggs once, got all tongue-tied."
Cameron,"Oh, you'll be fine. Oh! Oh, Lily, it's time for school, sweetie."
Gloria,"Oh, I can take her."
Cameron,"Oh. That'd be great. Yeah, it'd give me some more time to clean the kitchen. Maybe do a little dusting."
Jay,"Delicious, Cam."
Haley,"Annie was amazing, so funny and cute and sweet."
Alex,"Yeah, you've said."
Haley,"She made this for me last night. Look how she signs her name with that big loopy ""a."" I'm totally going to frame this."
Alex,"I made this for Haley four years ago. You think this got framed? She tossed it in the garbage... Right after she wrote ""Mrs. Haley Jonas Brothers"" on it, like, 30 times."
Mitchell,"The tax write-off alone makes financial sense. You know, even if you take the environment out of it."
Mitchell,"Okay. Well, we're shooting from two different angles, but, uh, hopefully we'll end up at the same place."
Jay,Mitch.
Mitchell,Dad?
Jay,"I just had to stop down and meet this guy. Booker Bell, I'm Boz Scaggs... No! I mean Jay Pritchett. Damn it."
Jay,This is such an honor. You are hands down my favorite radio personality of all time.
Mitchell,"Okay. Well, thanks for stopping by, dad."
Jay,"You know, I gotta tell you one thing."
Mitchell,I'll see you back at the house.
Jay,"One time when I was driving from Youngstown to Sugar Creek, you called this guy at a Kitty Litter Company and you asked him to bring over 900 pounds of litter, and in the background, you hear all these lions roaring, and... I-I-I laughed so hard, I almost had an accident."
Jay,"Funny as ever! Anyway... Hey, are you still in touch with the old gang? Grandma Groovy? Spaceman Clyde?"
Jay,No way.
Jay,"My God, it's like she's here!"
Mitchell,She is here! How are you still not getting this? That's her.
Mitchell,What are you doing?
Jay,What? I'm a fan. I came down to say hi.
Mitchell,"This is a business meeting. Do you have any idea how inappropiate this is? No. No, of course you don't, because as far as you're concerned, all a lawyer does is walk into a bar with a rabbi and polar bear."
Jay,"Grizzly, 'cause otherwise, with the bartender..."
Mitchell,"Dad! I'm working! You're embarrasing both of us! Please, you gotta go!"
Jay,"Okay, I didn't realize that."
Mitchell,Yeah. Yeah. You didn't.
Jay,"I'm sorry,"
Mitchell,Go!
Mitchell,"Oh, he's gone. I've got rid of him. I'm sorry that he attacked you like that."
Mitchell,"Well, just I thought since this was a business meeting, we should..."
Mitchell,There's been a lot of tension between me and my dad. I'm actually staying at his house...
Mitchell,I get the sense that I'm losing you. Could I talk to Grandma Groovy?
Phil,": Honey, I'm home."
Phil,What? You?
Claire,"Yeah, look who came by to fix the table."
Phil,Wow. What a guy. Yeah.
Claire,Mm-hmm. He also brought some wine.
Phil,"Boy, do you know the way to this gal's heart."
Phil,Really? That's great.
Claire,"Oh, no, no. No, no, if it's business..."
Phil,He insists. We'll be there. We're coming.
Phil,7:00 sounds great.
Phil,All right.
Claire,Wow.
Phil,"""Wow"" is right."
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,I just got sycamore... a house that sells itself and gives me the commission.
Claire,How does that not bother you?
Phil,"Claire, it's an expression. There's work. Inspections, appraisals..."
Claire,"He brought me wine, he took his shirt off when you weren't here!"
Phil,"Um, he brought us wine, and it doesn't look super vacuumed down there. I'm surprised he kept his pants on."
Claire,"Okay. Okay, I can see what's going on. You... you're just so focused on getting his business, that you don't see what's going on in front of you."
Phil,Okay. Now I do see what's going on.
Claire,What?
Phil,"Come here, pretty girl."
Claire,What? Mm?
Phil,"You are, you know. You don't hear it enough. The other night, when you put on makeup, I was like, ""there she is."""
Claire,"Oh, my God. You think I'm making this up as some part of a-an ego boost? Do you realize how insulting that is?"
Alex,What are you doing?
Haley,Helping my little sister with her homework.
Alex,That seems... mean.
Haley,"Annie, this is Alex. That other sister I was telling you about."
Alex,"Um, if you're going to study there, you might need to correct numbers 7 through 10. This bed has higher standards than that bed."
Gloria,We're back!
Cameron,"Oh, well, there you are. I guess ""lunch then home"" means different things to different people."
Gloria,"We had a girls' day. Lily, Lily, come! Show your papa what we bought!"
Gloria,"It's like she's the baby leopard, and I'm the mama."
Cameron,"Or they just happened to have two jackets, one large, one small."
Gloria,What happened here? Where is my tea?
Cameron,"Oh, it's in this drawer over here. As a thank-you, I took some time to rearrange your kitchen so it makes sense."
Gloria,To who?
Cameron,To everyone. There's a flow now. Watch... Tea. Mug. Kettle. You're welcome.
Gloria,I didn't thank you.
Cameron,You don't have to.
Gloria,I won't.
Manny,"Cam, our shared bathroom is not the place to work out whatever's going on here."
Manny,"I'm a child of divorce. Conflict resolution is something of a specialty. The key is, tell a personal story that applies to their situation, even if you have to make one up. That way, they really hear what they need to hear."
Cameron,I'm sorry. You're right.
Manny,"No. I'm sorry I snapped. I'm just going through some stuff with this girl I like, Danielle. She came over the other day, and Stella was all over her, and--and I got jealous. Which is crazy, right? I mean, Stella was only playing with her because she was new."
Cameron,"Manny, sounds like Danielle was trying to get between you and your puppy, and that ain't cool. She seems immature, and you can do better. I'm sorry to be blunt, but I'm going through something myself right now. So, chin up. Okay."
Manny,"It may not work every time, but you only need one fish to bite."
Gloria,Who is this Danielle?
Manny,"She's my study partner in my history class, and we share a notebook. But her notes were really confusing, so I put them in order. Instead of thanking me for making our lives easier, she got all mad because she thought I was judging her."
Gloria,"This girl is very bad news, Manny. You stay away from her."
Phil,Hey.
Claire,Hi.
Phil,We're Phil and Claire.
Claire,Okay.
Phil,"Great, thanks."
Claire,Wow. I don't like the way that kid was looking at you.
Phil,We are not friends right now.
Claire,I am only here to help pump up the college fund.
Phil,"Claire, if Tad even makes a move towards you, his ass is... grass."
Claire,Really? I thought that was just my ego.
Phil,"So far, yeah, but just know, I'm ready to grass his ass."
Phil,Hey! How are you!
Phil,Good to see you.
Claire,Hi. That's good.
Phil,"Well, I love the place."
Phil,Did you remodel this?
Phil,"Really? Wow. I love how open it is. Do you mind if I, uh, poke around?"
Phil,Beautiful.
Phil,"I saw this house eight years ago. There used to be a wall here, right?"
Phil,Yeah. I'm a detail guy. Hard to get much past me.
Phil,"These stairs used to be teak, am I right?"
Claire,"Yeah, he's good. He's sharp."
Phil,Yep. I don't miss much.
Haley,"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you trying to read?"
Alex,You're the one who tries to read.
Haley,"Oh, my gosh! I am not that stupid!"
Alex,"Seriously, Haley, you think you are the coolest person ever!"
Haley,Would you please stop just judging me and everything that I do?
Alex,"""Look at me! I'm so cool!"""
Luke,"Enough! Enough! I am so sick of you two fighting all the time! You're a bad big sister, and you're a bad little sister! And you're both bad big sisters to me. Be normaler."
Haley,Wow.
Alex,I've never seen him like that.
Haley,"Well, we do kind of neglect him. And if you think about it, he is kind of... our little sister."
Alex,Remember how we used to dress him up?
Haley,I miss her.
Luke,"I hear you, and I don't like where this is going!"
Haley,"You get the lipstick, I'll get the bra and tennis balls."
Alex,Betty Luke!
Luke,I will burn this house down!
Gloria,Where is the cheese grater? Where is the cutting board?
Cameron,Where would you want it to be?
Gloria,"Yes, right here next to the cheese grater."
Gloria,"I know it's hard to tell by looking at me, but I am not a natural homemaker. So when Cam came and organized my kitchen, I felt insecure and lashed out. In a way, I'm no better than Manny's crazy friend Danielle."
Cameron,"Please, can we just focus on the cooking?"
Cameron,I love it.
Cameron,"I guess I've always been a little sensitive about Lily not having a mother, and Gloria's so good at it. I got jealous. Maybe I should tell Manny this story. It might help him with that train wreck Danielle."
Cameron,You know what? Why don't you turn that music back on. Was kind of nice.
Mitchell,"Hey, dad..."
Jay,"No need to talk about it. I was out of line coming down there, won't happen again. Scotch is at the bar."
Mitchell,"No, I've been giving this a lot of thought."
Jay,I guess we're gonna talk about it.
Mitchell,"I was rude to you. I think I was just annoyed by all the lawyer jokes. I mean, let's be honest, you don't exactly beam with pride over what I do for a living."
Jay,Mockery is the sincerest form of flattery.
Mitchell,"Pretty sure that's... that's not the saying, but, um, you know, Manny told me a story about his friend Danielle. She sounds like a real piece of work, by the way. But, uh, it made me realize that I take myself a little too seriously."
Jay,"Listen, it goes without saying I've always been proud of you, and I brag about you all the time. So if I say, ""what do lawyers use as birth control?"" And the answer is, ""their personalities,"" I want you to know I'm not referring to you. You don't need any birth control. Hello? Yeah, this is Jay Pritchett. What? When? What happened? It's the police. My car got stolen. Yeah, 2012. Gray. No, not pewter. More like a light... Like a... no, not slate. I don't even know what ""coastal fog"" is. Just put down ""gray."" Kilo? It's not my car. Yes, she's Columbian. What does that have to do with... no, I'm coming down there. Hang on. Grab your keys. I think I might need a lawyer."
Mitchell,That's good. That's good.
Claire,Whoa.
Phil,Wow!
Phil,"Fun night, right? Great dinner?"
Claire,"Yes. Yes, and... Tad is... great, and I know I was giving you a hard time..."
Phil,Hey.
Claire,But I feel like I should say that I am sorry.
Phil,"Hey, hey, hey, Claire, you don't need to explain. Your apology is apology enough."
Claire,A monkey problem!
Phil,"Yeah, I heard him the first time."
Phil,"You can kiss my wife, you can take her to bed, but you cannot make her laugh. I wanna go back. You can kiss my wife, but only I can take her to bed and make her laugh. I wanna go back. Only I can take my wife to bed, comma, and make her laugh."
Claire,The monkeys love bananas! You would think they would love the bananas.
Phil,"Yeah, we should go."
Claire,Come on. The bananas...
Phil,"Yeah, we need to go. We gotta get going."
Claire,"Oh, no, no, no."
Phil,"Yeah, yeah, we're late."
Claire,But he just opened the...
Phil,We're late for getting home. Thanks for everything. Just...
Claire,Okay.
Claire,What is wrong with you?
Phil,"You laughed like it was ""who's on first?"""
Claire,What? He's on second.
Phil,Don't try to cheer me up.
Claire,I know what's going on here. You're jealous.
Phil,"Of him? He's not even funny! What's he got? Like, a soft ten minutes? And he goes to the Costa Rican well a little too much for my taste."
Claire,"Oh, God."
Phil,Really? This is still about the monkey?
Claire,"No! No, no, no! It's you. You are making me so happy right now. You stormed out of there, and you're acting like an idiot."
Phil,You like this? Because I am really uncomfortable.
Claire,"Honey, I love it. Makes me feel special."
Phil,"Sometimes, I really don't understand you."
Claire,"I know. It's stupid, but it's nice to know that sometimes you'll fight for me, and all I have to do is laugh at some other guy's story. But no one makes me laugh like you do."
Phil,As long as it's always genuine.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,"You can fake anything you want with me, but not your laugh. I'd like to go back."
Claire,Yeah.
Luke,Stop it! Leave me alone!
Alex,Hold still!
Haley,Stop moving!
Luke,I hate you! Get off of me!
Phil,What... is going on?
Claire,"You guys are in a lot of trouble. Haley, I told you to clean this mess up, and, Alex, your books are everywhere. Betty Luke, sit down while your dad gets the camera."
Phil,Got it.
Claire,"Last time, you made a funny face and we didn't really get a good shot, so let's work on our smile."
Phil,"Okay. Good to see you, Betty Luke."
Phil,Whoa. What's all this?
Haley,Mom heard us say we were bored.
Phil,Suckers.
Alex,She heard us from outside.
Haley,"She has super good hearing, like a seeing eye dog. They have overdeveloped hearing to make up for the fact that-- Wait, the dogs aren't blind. Wait. Are they? No, that wouldn't make sense."
Alex,"You're right. If I wait long enough, she can get there by herself."
Phil,"Quick, girls... famous Danny from ""Moonstruck."" Aiello?"
Mitchell,"Hey, Phil. I'm glad I caught ya."
Phil,What's up?
Mitchell,"Uh, it's about Steven and Stefan. They wanna see that house on Briar again."
Phil,"Really? I showed it to them five times. Last time we were there, I think they got mail."
Mitchell,"Yeah, well, that's why I'm calling. They hate upsetting people,"
Phil,"It's no problem. I'm just hanging around. Kind of bored, really. What?"
Mitchell,"Well, we did our good deed for the day."
Cameron,"Yeah, for the enemy. Don't they have enough?"
Mitchell,"It's been about a year since we decided to adopt a boy. Meanwhile, our friends Steven and Stefan decided that they wanted a baby, too."
Cameron,Wonder where they got that idea?
Mitchell,"Well, we're still waiting, but they already got their kid because they went through a surrogate."
Cameron,Which is all they talk about.
Mitchell,Are you gonna keep doing that?
Cameron,I might.
Phil,"I have to go show a house. But first, what was Elton John's sexual orientation in the '70s?"
Haley,Bye.
Alex,You've done that one before.
Phil,"And it never gets old, like the good Captain Fantastic himself. Hey, Claire, guess what?"
Claire,"I'm sorry, honey, I can't talk right now. I told Bethenny I would take her to the airport. I'm late, and she's gonna miss her flight. Where are my keys? Why is that chair still here? I thought you and Luke were gonna put it out on the sidewalk."
Phil,So you can't talk unless it's about my chores?
Claire,"Why don't you just do it now, and you won't be so bored?"
Phil,You heard that?
Claire,I hear everything.
Luke,That's for me.
Phil,"Hey, Leon. Nice buzz cut."
Phil,Nice to see you.
Claire,"Oh, no. No... oh, God. Um, Alex, do not move. Haley, clean this up, okay?"
Haley,Who fills a vase with marbles?
Claire,Who doesn't see a vase filled with marbles?
Alex,"Who wants to hear a bunch of plates crashing? Phil! Honey, the girls need you in the kitchen!"
Luke,"Thanks for the hat, Leon. It kind of tickles."
Claire,Phil!
Luke,It's not rocket science. We're only reanimating a squirrel.
Claire,Phil! Now!
Jay,"Sounds great. No, hang on. Gloria, where's Manny? Some neighborhood kids have invited him to play football."
Gloria,He said he was taking his morning constitutional.
Jay,"He's working on his go-cart, but he'll be there. Okay. See you then."
Gloria,"No, Manny cannot go and play with those boys. Margo is trying to get us theater tickets for this afternoon."
Jay,"Gloria, you and Manny do enough together. Let's let him decide. Where's he walking?"
Gloria,"I don't know. But according to the song he was singing, he was going to the sunny side of the street."
Jay,I cannot express to you enough how bad this kid needs football.
Manny,Mom! Look what I found! Number 99!
Gloria,"When Manny was 5, we didn't have much. We were on our own. So we always dreamed of winning the lottery."
Manny,"We figured if we collected 100 lucky heads-up pennies and bought a ticket with them, we couldn't lose."
Gloria,"But now I have a wonderful husband, a beautiful home... I feel like I already won the lottery."
Manny,So I can keep whatever we win?
Gloria,I think no. I found most of them.
Manny,Can you put this in the jar with the others?
Gloria,Sí. Ay. I forgot. What is the combination to your safe?
Manny,I'll just come with you.
Jay,"Oh, yes, 'cause that's how this arrangement works... I take money from you! Hello? Oh, hi, Margo. No, she just ran upstairs. Listen, about these theater tickets... don't knock yourself out trying to... Oh, you did? Well, sorry to do this last minute, but they can't go. No, Manny has a football game, so..."
Manny,"Jay, could you steep my tea?"
Jay,I cannot express to you enough how much this kid needs football.
Phil,And that is the whole house... Again.
Phil,"Oh, yeah."
Phil,We have an expression around the office for when a sale just isn't
Phil,"Not sure if I mentioned it before, but the house does come with a hookup for a European washing machine."
Phil,"Oh, so sorry. It's the boss. Hey."
Claire,"Hi. I'm on my way home. I've been calling Haley, but nobody's answering. Is everything okay there?"
Phil,Everything here is great.
Claire,"Oh, thank God. Did you put the chair out front?"
Phil,Not yet.
Claire,"Honey, you're gonna miss the trash pickup."
Phil,"Don't worry. If they don't take it, someone else will."
Claire,Who is gonna pick up that ratty chair off our lawn?
Phil,"Are you kidding? It's in great shape. Super cozy. People are always commenting on it. Trust me, it'll be gone by the end of the day."
Claire,"Please, just do it now."
Phil,"I can't. I'm so sorry. When I'm done with these clients, I'll call Luke and Leon. I know I can talk them into it."
Claire,"What do you mean, ""call Luke and Leon""? Aren't you at home?"
Phil,"No, I left right before you did."
Claire,"Phil, the house... the... the kids... Oh, God, the squirrel."
Phil,Hello?
Phil,Oh!
Phil,Commission... Accomplished.
Mitchell,"So how great is your life right now, huh? A new house, a new baby, Stefan's Propecia's kicking in."
Cameron,"Oh, well, what wonderful parents you are."
Mitchell,"No. God, no."
Cameron,Just a little.
Cameron,"Well, we considered it, but how do you decide which one will... Where's Lily?"
Mitchell,Sleeping.
Cameron,Ice the cupcake.
Mitchell,That you couldn't say in front of Lily?
Cameron,"Well, then, she'd want a cupcake."
Mitchell,"Yeah, well..."
Mitchell,The swirl?
Mitchell,"Yeah, maybe we should think about this swirl."
Cameron,"Well, I-I didn't think surrogacy was for us. But, you know, 'cause one of us would feel left out."
Mitchell,"Yeah, but if you don't know whose it is..."
Cameron,Roco or cocoa?
Jay,Look at him out there.
Gloria,"Oh, ay. This is so exciting."
Jay,Go ahead! Attaboy! Go! Go ahead! Attaboy!
Gloria,"Go, Manny! Run!"
Jay,"I knew Gloria would find out I lied about those tickets. But I figured when she saw Manny out there, playing with all those other kids, she'd thank me. That's what I figured."
Jay,Go! Go! What the hell's he doing?
Gloria,"Run, Manny! Run!"
Manny,Mom! Number 100! Now we have the lucky... Oh!
Claire,"Oh, thank God. Nobody's dead."
Luke,Or... we're all dead.
Claire,How many plates did we lose?
Alex,None. Luke and Haley used cookie sheets to clear a path through the marbles for me.
Claire,Where are the marbles?
Haley,Right here.
Claire,"Oh, Haley!"
Haley,I put glue on them so it doesn't happen again.
Claire,What about the chair?
Luke,Leon and I rolled it outside on some skateboards.
Claire,Oh. The squirrel?
Alex,You think I was going to let that happen?
Claire,"These kids are going to survive. They are the best of me and Phil. Luke using the skateboards, Haley gluing the marbles... that is pure Phil. Alex keeping everyone in line... pure me. Sometimes I worry no one's gonna like Alex."
Jay,"There you go, buddy."
Manny,Thank you. Uh...
Jay,What? You need anything? I'll get it.
Jay,"Steak sauce, but it's okay. It's probably good for me to move around."
Gloria,"Oh, Jay, it's so nice to see you take care of him like that."
Jay,Why are you surprised? He's our kid. We take care of each other in this family.
Gloria,I want to kill you.
Jay,Wild guess... Margo? Let me explain.
Gloria,There is no excuse.
Manny,This is something private. I'm gonna get outta here.
Gloria,So that's why you were being so nice. You lied to my friend... You made Manny play the American football... It is your fault that he got estampeded.
Jay,"Or is it your fault? He stopped to pick up a penny, for God's sake."
Gloria,"Be careful what you say, Jay. You're skating on thin eggshells right now."
Jay,I tried to get him out there with kids his own age... Which is what he should be doing... And not spending another afternoon with his mommy.
Gloria,"If you have a problem with the way Manny's being raised, you talk to me!"
Jay,I am.
Gloria,I don't wanna hear it!
Mitchell,"Phil, you really didn't have to do this."
Phil,I sold a house today because of you two. The least I can do is buy you dinner.
Claire,I saw that house. It is gorgeous.
Phil,I know.
Mitchell,"Yes, we're real happy for them."
Jay,They showed me a picture of the baby. How adorable is that little guy?
Cameron,"Yes, we're real happy for them."
Mitchell,"Okay, you might wanna slow down there."
Cameron,"What? I'm playing a new drinking game. It's called ""every time I'm depressed, I take a drink."""
Mitchell,That game exists. It's called alcoholism.
Cameron,"Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. I'm... I'm wallowing, and it's not cute. To happier things."
Mitchell,Yes.
Phil,To happier things.
Claire,"Happier things, yes."
Phil,There you go.
Phil,"I remember the first few drinks... And, um, after that, the night's just bits and pieces."
Claire,"I wanna do something I never do... brag about my kids. Today, they were resourceful, they were responsible, they..."
Phil,Put 40% down. It was worth showing the house five times and waiting...
Cameron,Almost a year. Seriously! Who do you have to...
Phil,Blow. That's really hot. Why don't you let it cool down? Try some of the...
Mitchell,Mexican! The baby is clearly Mexican!
Cameron,"So, you know, the swirl is out."
Mitchell,Ugh. It's enough to make you lose...
Claire,"Track. Is this my fourth drink? It's my fourth. I said ""four"" twice, didn't I? I did, didn't I?"
Mitchell,I think we're gonna need four cabs...
Phil,Two! Two!
Mitchell,You made me!
Phil,I-I vaguely remember... someone crying?
Cameron,": If we ever did surrogacy, I would want you to be the donor."
Mitchell,Mnh-mnh!
Cameron,"You're so smart, you're so handsome."
Mitchell,"Oh, stop it! It should be you! You're so fun! You're so talented!"
Phil,"Okay. It's not fair. I love you both so much. If you could have a baby that was a mix of the two of you, I would love that baby so much."
Claire,"Aw, that is so sweet."
Phil,I meant it.
Claire,"That is so sweet. Oh, my God. You guys, we could do this. We could do this. We could make a baby that is half Tucker and half Pritchett."
Phil,Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,Cloning?
Claire,No. No. I'm saying... I give the egg.
Phil,Oh!
Claire,"Yeah. I give the egg. That's the Pritchett side. And then, Cam, you're the father, right? And then we just, like, mix it and put it in a, like, a surrogate lady thing, and then bang! We have a baby."
Mitchell,Oh. Are... are you serious?
Cameron,You would do that?
Claire,"I would be honored. You guys, you guys, if there's one thing I have learned today, it's the pleasure of looking at your children, and seeing both... both of you in there. And I want you to have that experience. Yeah."
Cameron,We want that.
Claire,"And something else... Guys, I make really good babies."
Mitchell,Yes.
Claire,"I have, like, magic eggs or something."
Mitchell,Yes!
Claire,They're golden.
Mitchell,"Oh, gosh. Oh, Phil, I don't... what do... what do you say about this?"
Phil,I think we're all having a baby! Aah! Table hug!
Phil,Sweet potato fries!
Claire,What have I done?
Phil,I know.
Claire,Oh.
Claire,What was I thinking? I-I-I just get drunk and I bring a baby into the world?
Phil,That would be 4 for 4.
Claire,I can't go through with it.
Phil,"Don't panic. You haven't donated anything yet. Besides, what are the chances your eggs even work? What are the chances we can pretend I never said that?"
Claire,"It's weird. It's my brother. And then there would be this baby over there that's my baby, but it's not my baby..."
Phil,That actually sounds good. Just say that. We're gonna see him for brunch in two hours over at your dad's.
Claire,Ooh. That seems... soon and... and hard. What if... what if I blame it on you? What if we say that you're not okay with it?
Phil,No!
Claire,Why? Are you really okay with another man fertilizing your wife's egg?
Phil,Of course not! That's creepy.
Claire,Yes.
Phil,"Plus, what if you and Cam make a better baby than we did?"
Claire,"It's settled. Phil says ""no."""
Phil,Like they're really gonna believe that I overruled you?
Claire,Right.
Phil,Come on.
Claire,Mm. They're gonna be crushed. They've waited so long for this baby.
Phil,"Maybe they're having second thoughts, too."
Cameron,Look... this is what my baby with Claire would look like.
Mitchell,What is this? What...
Cameron,"Okay, well, I found a web site where couples can upload pictures... And then it shows them what their baby would look like. This is... Gloria and I. Couldn't resist."
Mitchell,Wow. That... that looks exactly like Manny. Like... like weirdly so. What... what's this other picture?
Cameron,Don't be jealous. But this... Is me and Justin Timberlake.
Mitchell,"Cam, we have a problem."
Cameron,"Oh, what? You can talk about Ryan Gosling all day, but the moment I say something--"
Mitchell,"No, no, no, about this baby. I... I don't think I can do it."
Cameron,"What--why? Why--it's perfect! It's our chance to have a baby that's part me, part you!"
Mitchell,"No, no! It's part you and part Claire. I'm nowhere in there. And it's not like I can pretend. It's... she's not some egg donor that we don't know. It's Claire. You know, we see her all the time. And what are we supposed to tell the baby? ""Say hi to your aunt mommy!"""
Cameron,Adorable.
Mitchell,"No, not adorable. Appalachian. Okay, I'm... I'm sorry, Cam."
Gloria,"Jay says that I'm smothering Manny... But I'm just enjoying him. I mean, they're only gonna be boys for a short time."
Phil,Best time ever in this house!
Manny,"I'm uncomfortable with this, Phil. The manual specifically says ""no towing."""
Phil,"There are two types of people in this world... people who follow the manual, and people who stick it to the manual. You... are hurt."
Mitchell,Hi!
Cameron,"Manny, what happened?"
Manny,Football injury. My mom will yell you all about it.
Gloria,"Hola, Lily! Does my little princess want a cookie?"
Cameron,"Oh, well, you know, maybe just one. She's already had her sugar limit for today."
Gloria,How can you tell?
Gloria,"Ay! Okay, Lily."
Claire,Hey.
Mitchell,"Hey, you two."
Cameron,"So where... oh, where are the kids?"
Claire,"Oh, Haley's driving them over separately."
Mitchell,Oh. Oh! Big girl now.
Claire,That's great.
Phil,So that was... so fun last night.
Mitchell,So fun.
Cameron,"Yeah, we had a great night."
Claire,Yeah. Yes.
Phil,We should... Jinx!
Mitchell,"Yeah, we're going this way, so..."
Cameron,This should do for 30.
Phil,Yeah.
Mitchell,We'll see you in a bit.
Claire,I cannot tell them. I cannot break their hearts.
Phil,So you're gonna have Cam's baby just to keep things from being weird?
Alex,": Um, what? You and Uncle Cam are having a baby?"
Phil,"Kids, shh. There was a discussion about the possibility..."
Phil,Of your mom donating an egg... so that the guys could have a baby.
Claire,But we decided it was not a good idea.
Luke,Why? Because Lily's such a mess?
Phil,For a lot of reasons. They have...
Luke,But we can agree that she's a disastrous human being?
Haley,I think it's a great idea.
Alex,"Yeah. It's a really beautiful offer, mom. I'm impressed."
Mitchell,"Oh, my God. Cam, they told the kids already, and they seem to be totally into it. All right, is it just me? Am I the only one that thinks this is weird?"
Cameron,Maybe it's not weird. Maybe we're pioneers.
Mitchell,"Mm, no we're hardly pioneers. You have three different hair dryers for different types of weather."
Cameron,Maybe it's just gonna take some time to get used to the idea.
Jay,What idea?
Mitchell,Oh. No.
Cameron,"Um, well, Jay..."
Mitchell,Cam.
Cameron,Claire has...
Mitchell,No. I-I-I just don't think my dad's really ready for this conversation. So...
Jay,"Oh, stop acting like I'm some stodgy old coot. I've grown."
Cameron,"Okay. Um, Jay, Claire has, um, offered to give us one of her eggs so we can have a baby that's half Pritchett, half Tucker."
Jay,That's unnatural. I'm against it.
Gloria,"Oh, surprise, surprise. Jay is against something."
Jay,Cam and Claire wanna have a baby together.
Gloria,Ugh! You're not gonna do that.
Mitchell,"It's not your decision, dad."
Jay,You're not thinking straight.
Mitchell,"And you're not in charge. Okay, Claire and I are adults. If... if we want this to happen, it... it's gonna happen."
Claire,So much for second thoughts.
Jay,"Young lady, I need to have a talk with you."
Claire,I don't... now?
Gloria,"No. You don't get to tell everyone how to live their lives, that boys cannot spend time with their mommies or that brothers and sisters can't make babies."
Jay,So you're all for this?
Gloria,"No. It's a freak show, but it's their freak show."
Cameron,So this is happening again?
Mitchell,"Well, I'm not gonna not do it 'cause my dad thinks I shouldn't."
Cameron,"You know, I'm not following."
Mitchell,We're not doing it 'cause I don't want to do it. What we're not doing is not doing it 'cause he doesn't want us to do it.
Cameron,Just say baby or no baby.
Jay,Isn't it enough this family spends a lot of time together? Now we have to inbreed.
Claire,"Okay, dad, it's not technically inbreeding. It's, um..."
Alex,"For the record, I think what my mom is doing is very brave."
Haley,"I like it. I've always kind of wanted a half-brother, half-cousin."
Jay,"Really? ""Always""?"
Haley,"Well, I mean, if you think about it..."
Claire,"Oh, wow. When was the last time we talked under a table?"
Mitchell,Dad and Gloria's wedding reception.
Claire,"Oh, yeah. Um, mm... I love you. You know that... But I can't do this."
Mitchell,"No, no, neither can I!"
Claire,Really?
Mitchell,Yeah.
Claire,"Are you serious? You can't... oh, God. I'm so relieved. I'm sorry. I-I-I... ugh. I am so sorry I led us down this road."
Mitchell,"No, no. No, Claire, don't be. Don't be. It was... it was generous and thoughtful, just like you. How could I not want those qualities in my child?"
Claire,"Ohh. Oh, come here."
Jay,So this is really happening?
Mitchell,"What if it is, dad?"
Claire,"Yeah. What if we love each other, and this is a beautiful thing?"
Mitchell,"Okay, it's our decision. It's not yours."
Cameron,So baby? No baby?
Mitchell,No.
Mitchell,You okay?
Cameron,"Oh, yeah. I'm fine."
Mitchell,"Mm, I know it's been hard on you. Hey, what if we went out for a nice dinner tonight?"
Cameron,"Oh, that'd be fun. Should I call the sitter?"
Mitchell,"Yeah. Oh, you know what I was thinking today? What about Luke?"
Cameron,"Oh, he's so good with her, the way he looks at her..."
Mitchell,"My God, Cam."
Mitchell,Look at how she's dressed.
Cameron,"Oh! We didn't make her, but she sure is us."
Mitchell,"Hey, Lily, honey, it might make more sense with the shoes..."
Cameron,Mitchell.
Mitchell,Because... I like what she did with the dolls...
Cameron,Play as you will. Play as you will.
Mitchell,It's nice.
Manny,"The big one, remember? One of the first ones we found. It was at the bottom of the gutter in the street."
Gloria,"Ay, yes. We put the gum at the bottom of your walking stick. Ay, look at this one... the green one, the one we found at the floor of my taxi."
Jay,Your taxi?
Gloria,"Yes. Before I had somebody running my life for me, I used to drive a taxi at night. Manny would sleep in the seat next to me. One time, I had to hit the brakes so hard that he fell into the floor and he found the penny."
Manny,"Pretty lucky, huh? Eight years. I can't believe we're finally done."
Gloria,"Me, either. Come. Let's go get your lottery ticket."
Jay,Gloria.
Gloria,Hmm?
Jay,I think you made a mistake here.
Gloria,What did I do now?
Jay,"I counted these, and you've only got 96 pennies."
Manny,Are you sure?
Jay,Afraid so. I guess you're gonna have to keep lookin'.
Manny,Dang it! I counted those.
Jay,See for yourself.
Cameron,And now we upload your picture.
Mitchell,This is fun. This is fun.
Cameron,"Yeah. And in just a few short moments, thanks to the magic of technology... We'll know what our baby actually looks..."
Mitchell,Oh! No!
Cameron,What happened? What is that?
Mitchell,Did you put one of us in upside-down?
Cameron,"No! That's actually... Okay, I-I don't want to see this anymore. Ohh. Turn it off."
Mitchell,"Oh, it's not turning off."
Cameron,"Well, throw something over it! That... oh, God!"
Mitchell,"Yeah, well, we played God, and look what we brought forth."
Cameron,Oh! Maybe it wasn't that bad.
Mitchell,"No, no, it's possible that we overreacted."
Cameron,Yeah. Maybe our expectations were just a little bit too high. That little guy had some cute features. Huh?
Mitchell,Of course he did. It's us. It can't be that bad. Yeah. Let's just take...
Cameron,"Ooh! Individual frittatas! What a treat. You're a lucky man, Phil."
Phil,"I'm always saying, I'm..."
Claire,Phil.
Phil,Sorry.
Claire,You left the milk out again.
Phil,Oh. Mmm.
Cameron,"I may have to take one of these little guys home. Claire, did you ever find that tupperware I lent you?"
Claire,"Sweetie, for the hundredth time, I gave it back to you, remember?"
Cameron,"I remember you telling me a hundred times, yet my pea soup is in baggies."
Gloria,Did you check your car? In the...
Jay,Trunk.
Gloria,"Because that's where you found that thing that you thought that you gave me long time ago, the... the..."
Jay,"Pizza cutter. Good, give me another one."
Cameron,"Yes, I was wrong that time. I..."
Mitchell,It's a piece of plastic. You're ruining brunch.
Jay,"Don't sweat it, Cam. I forget things all the time. Like I can never remember the name of that weather guy that I liked. Uh... Thunder something. Stormy... Flash stormy? Ah, whatever the hell it is. I don't know."
Gloria,"Mm, just eat your eggs, Jay."
Jay,"Oh, ho ho ho!"
Cameron,Grandpa got told!
Luke,Look at them. They all think Lily's so great.
Manny,The novelty will wear off.
Luke,We used to be the cute ones. Now she gets all the attention. We need to take her down.
Jay,"And I should remember his name, too, because your mom and I got in a big fight over him. She was using the convertible, and I told her, ""put the top up because it's supposed to rain tonight, according to..."" P-p-p-partly Mccloudy? Whatever the hell his name is. Anyway... She didn't. Ruined the car."
Mitchell,"Well, not to be the one that always come to mom's defense... What? It was 20 years ago. What, you think he's gonna ground you?"
Jay,It was you?
Claire,"Yes. Yes, I left the top down, and I let mom take the fall."
Mitchell,And then they got divorced.
Claire,12 years later.
Mitchell,I'm just saying.
Claire,Ugh. You're ruining brunch.
Jay,Relax. It was years ago. There's a statute of limitation on this stuff.
Claire,"In that case, I should probably let you know I let the top down to let out the cigarette smoke. Not... not mine. Not mine. My... my bad friend Eleanor."
Mitchell,Eleanor being her boyfriend Allen.
Claire,Statute of limitations.
Jay,"Oh, relax, it's okay. Remember when I told you that I couldn't get to your figure skating semifinal because I was stuck at work?"
Claire,Yeah.
Jay,"Well, by ""stuck"" I meant ""drunk,"" and by ""work"" I meant ""the golf course."""
Claire,Wow. Dad!
Mitchell,"Oh, no. I got one. I got one. Remember that time we went golfing together, and you got a hole-in-one?"
Jay,Yeah?
Mitchell,You never got a hole-in-one. I got bored and I kicked it in the hole.
Phil,"This is fun. Here's a corker. They didn't used to label babies as carefully in hospitals, so for two days..."
Jay,"Not now, Phil. What do you mean, you... you kicked the ball in the hole? What, was it, like, on the edge?"
Mitchell,"Yeah, it was on the edge of that, uh... What? That... that sandy thing."
Jay,"Gee, it's sure gonna be fun to face my friends today."
Mitchell,"Well, you don't have to tell them."
Jay,"They call me ""ace,"" Mitch. I haven't paid for a lemonade down there in 20 years."
Mitchell,You're mad at me? Mm.
Cameron,You did!
Manny,This ends today.
Luke,A little help here?
Manny,You can't expect me to focus when Miranda Cornell lives right down your street. She's like a dream wrapped in a wish poured into jeggings.
Luke,"Yeah, yeah, that's nice and all, but we got a trap to set."
Manny,Are you sure this is going to work?
Luke,Trust me. We'll use these cookies as bait. Lily's crazy for them.
Manny,Asian metabolism.
Luke,"When she grabs them with her grubby little hands, off goes the trap. Boom... Big puddle of milk. She'll get in so much trouble. My mom hates messes."
Manny,I'm familiar with Claire.
Luke,Lock... and loaded. Mmm! These cookies are so good... And so easy to reach. Lily!
Mitchell,"Oh, my God! Cam!"
Cameron,Oh! Ohh!
Gloria,What happened? Are you okay?
Cameron,"Oh! That milk... fell, and I must have slipped in it!"
Phil,Did I leave that out again? I'm so sorry!
Cameron,Oh! My back! Ooh! My back!
Phil,"Can I give you a Swedish massage, accent optional?"
Cameron,"Oh! Oh, no, I just need to lie down."
Phil,Come on. Let's just get you over to the sofa.
Cameron,Do you think it would be offensive if I asked our daughter to walk on my back?
Phil,I'd say so. I just offered to give you a massage.
Gloria,What is she talking about?
Mitchell,"Oh, it's a ""My sweet companion"" doll. They all have these elaborate backstories. Beatrice works with blind dolphins and models."
Gloria,There are blind models? That's so sad. They cannot see how pretty they are.
Phil,Okay. Hold on. Here we go. Give me some. Give me some. Give me some. Oh! Let me buy Lily a new doll. It's my fault Cam fell.
Mitchell,"No, no need. Uh, the My sweet companion store actually has a hospital with an on-call doctor."
Phil,"Well, I can go. I'm taking the girls to the mall anyway."
Cameron,"Oh, that'd be great. Yeah. And don't worry. She has medical insurance."
Mitchell,"Yeah, and I think we've met our deductible for the year, so you should be good."
Cameron,Yeah.
Gloria,Do you know what a doll is in my village? An apple on a fork.
Alex,I never really got dolls. Does that make me weird? Haley ; It's on the list.
Phil,You're not weird.
Haley,"You just kind of skipped the little girl stage. And jumped to the ""I dare you to ring her doorbell"" stage."
Alex,The only stage you're ever going to jump on has a pole on it.
Haley,"Hey, at least I have the body..."
Phil,Okay! Okay! We're gonna have to settle this dispute in court... the food court. The honorable Judge Cinnabon presiding.
Haley,The food court? That place smells like the inside of Luke's bicycle helmet.
Alex,I like the food court.
Phil,"Don't worry, girls. We're not gonna deprive ourselves just 'cause of Haley's aversion to food..."
Alex,"Oh. Oh, Haley's ""aversion."" I thought you said... Never mind."
Claire,"Okay, so after you have turned on the monitor and selected your input, you can change the channel with this guy. But if you need to change the volume..."
Cameron,You know what? I think I'm fine. Why don't you just go ahead?
Claire,"I know this sounds really confusing, but there's actually a very simple way to remember it. Input 1 is the cable box cable box, ca..."
Cameron,I think I'm just gonna take a nap.
Claire,Okay. I'm going to yoga.
Gloria,Ay! That sounds like so much fun.
Cameron,"Oh, you should go with her, Gloria!"
Claire,"Oh, we should definitely do that sometime. I would love it. Bye!"
Gloria,Do you see how she gives me the cold shoulders? I don't even know why I try. Ay. Sorry.
Cameron,"Oh, well, that's just Claire, you know? She's a Pritchett. You gotta break through those walls. The sooner the better."
Gloria,You really think so?
Cameron,Yeah. Why don't you go? Now. Forge that friendship!
Gloria,"Okay, I go. I have my gym bag in the car. Feel better!"
Cameron,"Okay, thank you! I'm just gonna lie here... Some ice on my back!"
Cameron,"I knew for a fact Claire never returned my tupperware, I just needed a few minutes alone to find it. And when I did, I'd never have to hear them snicker again, ""Oh, silly Cam"" or ""forgetful Cam,"" because revenge is a dish best served cold. And even better, two days later out of 24-ounce microwave-friendly burp-sealed pak-n-stor."
Cameron,"Oh, hey! I thought you were going to the pharmacy."
Mitchell,I forgot my phone. Oh. I think I'm just upset about this stupid thing with my dad.
Cameron,"Well, sweetie, I'd love to hear about it when you come back with my heating pad from the pharmacy, because I hurt my back, remember?"
Mitchell,"I mean, did he overreact or what? It's just a game, right?"
Cameron,"Well, unless there's something more to it. Maybe you should go talk to him."
Mitchell,"Yeah. Oh, I should have just kept my mouth shut. I mean, it was such a great day. After he thought he got that hole-in-one, he took us out to dinner. He bought me my first beer."
Cameron,"Well, there you go. He's probably hurt because you marred a very special father-son experience."
Mitchell,You think?
Cameron,Ya marred it. But you can fix it. He's down at the club right now. Un-mar that memory!
Mitchell,You know what? I'm gonna do it.
Cameron,Ow.
Mitchell,Sorry. Don't worry. I'll be back soon.
Cameron,Okay! I'll miss you! Call first.
Haley,What were you thinking saying that in front of him?
Alex,"I'm sorry. It slipped out. Besides, I figured he knew."
Haley,"Mom knows. Only because she dragged it out of Dylan. And she promised not to tell dad until I left for college, which means he might have never found out."
Alex,Stop panicking. We don't even know for sure he heard what I said.
Phil,"Okay. Beatrice is with the nurse. They'll call us. Shouldn't be too long. We can just wait until she's married. Until she's... ready. Which, apparently, everyone is these days. Funny, I used to think it'd be years until everyone was ready, but I guess I was wrong. Wrong and naive."
Gloria,Surprise!
Claire,Oh! Gloria. My God.
Gloria,I came to do yoga with you.
Claire,I wasn't expecting to see you here.
Gloria,"Yeah, that's why I say ""surprise!"""
Claire,"Oh, yeah. This is awful, because I was just thinking I might have to bail on yoga. I have the worst headache all of a sudden."
Gloria,"Oh, but yoga is good for that, Claire. For the meditation, for the mmm..."
Claire,"Yeah, yeah. It's just right now I wanna go lie down in a dark room and breathe."
Gloria,That sounds like yoga.
Claire,"I... I realize that. Yes. But still, I-I... should go."
Gloria,"Come on. I'm not gonna do the class by myself. Okay, so let's go and get massages. Or there's a nail salon there."
Claire,"Ooh, I would love to do that some other time, I really would. But right now I need to get home and lie down. You understand, right?"
Gloria,Of course.
Claire,Okay.
Gloria,You go! And lie.
Manny,You're better!
Cameron,"Oh! Barely. Barely, yeah. I was just getting something cold for my back."
Luke,"Gravy? Well, if it can save your mom's turkey, it can save anything. I thought you were going to see your friend Miranda."
Luke,"This one chickened out. For someone who says he likes girls so much, he sure is afraid of them."
Manny,"It's a dance, Luke."
Luke,Chicken dance.
Cameron,"Well, since you're back, what if I give you 20 bucks, and you guys... Go wash my car?"
Luke,"Is that 20 bucks for each of us, or both of us?"
Cameron,Both.
Luke,That's what I thought.
Jay,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't smell you idiots come in. Listen, I've been thinking, maybe it's time we retire the name ""Ace."""
Jay,"You know, guys, about that..."
Jay,"Yeah, yeah, well, I'm just glad one of those cheap hair plugs didn't get caught in it."
Jay,"So I'm trying to find a way to come clean about the hole-in-one, when it occurs to me... Why? One idiot lies about his sex life, the other dumbbell has a Ferrari ""in the shop"" for years, and moron number three is a Hollywood stunt car driver who gets sick when he rides backwards in the golf cart."
Jay,So you ladies ready to tee off or what?
Jay,I took care of it.
Mitchell,"I-I'm sorry to interrupt, but my dad never lied to you guys."
Jay,Mitchell...
Mitchell,"No, he didn't even know until today that he never made the hole-in- one."
Jay,Okay.
Mitchell,"But the fact that he couldn't live with himself when he found out, and he raced down here to confess to you, that just shows the kind of man he is. He is a hole-in-one kind of man."
Jay,I didn't tell them.
Mitchell,So this is the gang. Introduce me.
Luke,Ahh. Score!
Manny,"It's not like me and Miranda are perfectly suited. For one thing, she likes bad boys. That's just not me."
Luke,I'm gonna turn on some music.
Manny,I'm sorry. I can't unlearn how to treat a lady. But where does that leave me? Waiting till I'm 40 when she looks me up on Facebook after a failed first marriage?
Luke,Okay.
Manny,What are you doing?
Luke,I'm sick of hearing you whine about Miranda! It's time to make her notice you!
Manny,But we can't!
Luke,"We got a full tank of gas, and she's right down the block. Now buckle up!"
Manny,Are you crazy?
Luke,You tell me.
Alex,"Lily, what is this? Don't you rather have a chemistry set or flash cards?"
Alex,"No. No, she's dirty. Look. Look at the dirt. Let me wipe her off. Fix that. One of her breeds is coming loose. Come here. Fix that right up."
Phil,What's the prognosis?
Haley,"Well, that's pretty good, right? I mean, she'll look exactly the same. No one will know."
Phil,"I'll know. I'm just saying I liked her the way she was. She was such a sweet little doll. I'm sorry, doctor. I'm having trouble adjusting to all this."
Haley,"Uh, dad, she's still a sweet little doll."
Phil,"No, she's broken."
Haley,"No, she's just changed a little. It happens. Dolls grow up."
Haley,"Uh, could you..."
Phil,"So, Haley... The thing is..."
Phil,"Fact... Haley's almost 18. Fact... I am the cool dad. Haley, I understand that sex is a part of life. I can't say that I'm thrilled to hear this, but I'm sure you're being safe, and I hope that you'll feel free to talk to me about this anytime."
Phil,"We should... We should probably get Beatrice, like, a-a cast or something, and we can all sign it. Yeah?"
Haley,"Uh, yeah. Sure."
Phil,Fact... I blew it.
Phil,This repair's probably gonna take a little while. Why don't you run up to the food court and grab us a table? I'll get Alex and Lily.
Haley,Okay. Do you want the counter or a booth?
Phil,Whatever seems right to you. I trust you.
Haley,I have a cool dad.
Luke,Okay. Your turn.
Manny,Unh-unh! No way!
Luke,"Do you wanna get her attention, or not?"
Manny,That was amazing! Did you see the look on Miranda's face?
Luke,"No. But you did good, Thelma."
Manny,Please stop calling me that. I hate that movie.
Luke,What movie?
Manny,Uh-oh! Dead end!
Luke,You gotta make a u-ey.
Manny,I don't know how to do that.
Gloria,"She pretended to have a headache, Cam. She doesn't want to spend time with me."
Cameron,Maybe she just wanted to be alone.
Gloria,Why?
Cameron,"Because some people really value their privacy, and you have to respect that."
Gloria,"I have to go. Hola, Claire!"
Claire,"Gloria, you've gotta stop doing that!"
Gloria,Were you going back to the yoga class without me?
Claire,"No, that is not why I came back."
Gloria,I don't understand you. Why you don't want to spend time with me? Everybody wants to spend time with me! Even the lady that did my nails wants to take me to pilates.
Claire,"I didn't come back here to do yoga. I don't do yoga. It's a cover, okay? Look... I know that from the outside, it seems like I have everything together."
Gloria,"No, not really."
Claire,My point is that my life can be very stressful. And I have found a way to cope with that stress. And it's my little secret. And I'm not proud of it.
Claire,Hey!
Gloria,Is that what you do?
Claire,No. No! Okay. You're coming with me. Come in. But listen to me. Gloria... It has to stay between us. This is my sacred space.
Claire,It's just such a great release. Thank you for not judging me.
Gloria,"Why would I? If anything, it makes me like you more."
Claire,Mm.
Gloria,So how often do you come here?
Claire,Not that often. No. Hey. Maybe a little often.
Gloria,That's so sad.
Claire,I live with four teenagers.
Gloria,You live with two adults.
Claire,You have no idea...
Gloria,"No, no, no. It's so sad that you come here so often and that's the best that you can shoot. And that's with pretty nails."
Claire,But improper stance. I...
Gloria,Practice more.
Claire,Okay.
Jay,Jay.
Mitchell,"Dad, I..."
Jay,"I told you, forget about it."
Mitchell,"All right. I-I just want you to know I get why you're upset, okay? That... that day you got the hole-in-one, it meant a lot to you. And... I... I marred it. But it meant a lot to me, too. We had a steak dinner, you gave me my first beer, and, uh... It was one of the greatest days we ever spent together. And it wasn't about some meaningless hole-in-one, it was about us."
Jay,No. It was about a hole-in-one.
Mitchell,"Yes. Yes. A-a little bit, maybe. But mostly, it was about how we bonded."
Jay,"I thought I hit a ball straight from the tee really, really far into a tiny hole."
Mitchell,"Okay. Well, when will I learn?"
Jay,"And it wasn't your first beer, anyway."
Mitchell,"Yes, it was, dad, but I wouldn't expect you to remember."
Jay,"It was your 14th birthday. You asked me for a sip of mine. Your mom yelled at you in front of all your friends, said you were just a baby. You ran outside in tears... Which, unfortunately, supported your mom's argument. Anyway, I came out with a couple of beers. We drank 'em on the porch watching the storm clouds coming in."
Mitchell,"I had completely forgotten about that. You know, you're... you're unbelievable. Just when I peg you as some..."
Jay,"Storm Stevens! That's it! Give me something. I'm gonna write it right here. Before I forget. ""Storm Stevens."" Stevens. What were we just talking about? Just now? No?"
Mitchell,Mnh-mnh.
Haley,"Come on, Lily. Let's see if Beatrice is ready."
Alex,"Hey, dad? I know I'm way too old for this, but do you think I could get this doll? Her name's Genevieve, and she's developing a vaccine for..."
Phil,"Yes, you can get the doll. You can get as many dolls as you want."
Alex,It's $200.
Phil,Or one is fine.
Cameron,I know you're here. Hello.
Manny,I have a bad feeling about this. What if one of your neighbors saw us? Maybe we should just confess.
Luke,We will... In 20 years.
Manny,Huh?
Luke,"You heard grandpa. There's a statute of limitations, which is a good thing because we still need to take Lily down."
Manny,"Nah, let her be the cute one. We don't need that anymore. We're bad boys now."
Luke,Yeah. I like that. Bad boys.
Manny,Your mom!
Gloria,"Oh, my God. Cam!"
Cameron,"Um, this had a lid?"
Haley,I'll see you guys later. I'm going to Abby's.
Claire,"Bye, honey. Have fun."
Phil,"Have fun, you! With Abby! We've confirmed Abby's a real person and a female?"
Claire,"Yes, sweetie. We met her. Honey, we can't treat Haley differently just because we both know what we know about her."
Phil,I know. I just need time. So Dylan told you? Why didn't he tell me? He and I used to share everything.
Claire,You're upset about a lot of things.
Phil,"Okay, I won't obsess over it. I just wanna ask you one thing. How long have you known?"
Claire,Three months.
Phil,"So this giant thing happened to our first born, and you kept me in the dark about it for three whole months?"
Claire,I'm sorry. I just wasn't sure how you'd... Okay.
Phil,Thank you.
Phil,"Come on, boys! It's leap day, not sleep day!"
Phil,I love leap day!
Claire,"It's kind of a big deal in the Dunphy house. This year, we even got Manny involved."
Phil,"You're given this gift of 24 extra hours. You can't waste it at work or school. You have to do something extraordinary, something shocking."
Claire,"Mm. This year, the entire family is taking a trapeze class."
Phil,How extraordinary is that?
Claire,It was my idea.
Phil,How shocking is that?
Claire,I can be spontaneous every four years.
Phil,I can't wait.
Gloria,Leap day is stupid.
Jay,"You're not understanding the logic behind it. A year is actually 365.25 days. Every four years, we gain one day. If we didn't adjust the calendar in, say, 40 years, February would almost be January."
Gloria,"That's not my problem, and it's definitely not your problem."
Jay,Look at this. The housekeeper turned another one of my whites pink. I can't wear this to a sports bar.
Gloria,"Mm, they're to going to be looking at you, Jay."
Jay,Somebody's feeling pretty good about herself.
Gloria,They're going to be watching the match.
Jay,You meant you a little bit.
Mitchell,"Okay, put it in there. All right, very quietly, we're gonna go to daddy's bedroom, open the door, and... Aah!"
Cameron,Happy Birthday to me.
Cameron,I'm 10!
Mitchell,40!
Cameron,"I was born February 29th, and there have been ten of those... In my lifetime, therefore I'm 10! It's fun."
Mitchell,"It's so much fun. Anyway, I-I've spent the last four years trying to figure to what kind of party to throw this one."
Cameron,"Oh, honey, you know I'd be fine with just a nice casual evening at home with you."
Mitchell,Don't... don't even. No. No! That's what he said last time.
Mitchell,"Okay, birthday boy, what's it gonna be... rom com or horror? Or we can do both and watch ""maid in Manhattan."" Whatcha doing?"
Cameron,Canceling our baby.
Cameron,"Okay, love to dad. Bye! Mwah!"
Mitchell,"Yeah, daddy, what are you doing? Snooping for hints about your birthday? Wow."
Cameron,"No, I... come on. No, I'm just excited, and I wanna be helpful. I know party planning isn't your thing."
Mitchell,"Y-you need to trust me, cam."
Cameron,"I know, and I do. It's not like you're gonna do anything tired, like appletinis or ice sculptures. Or synthetic napkins or anything mylar."
Mitchell,"Cam, that's enough! I've been paying for your last party for four years. And I find it a little insulting that you don't think I can pull this off."
Cameron,You know what? I trust you. I'm letting go.
Mitchell,Okay.
Cameron,"Okay? You know orange is over, right?"
Mitchell,It's a simple party. I can do it.
Cameron,Simple. Perfect.
Mitchell,"Yeah, just a simple party. I'm simply taking Cam's favorite movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and turning our house into an Oz-themed extravaganza... yellow brick carpet, waitstaff in full costume, and custom-made Ruby slippers for Cam. Whazzup?!"
Manny,So is this safe?
Luke,It's a trapeze.
Phil,Relax. More people are killed by knife-wielding strangers than from trapezing.
Manny,I'm thinking about going home now.
Phil,"Honey, are you okay?"
Claire,I'm fine. I'm watching... It's so sad.
Phil,"Oh, no. Not today."
Luke,What's wrong?
Phil,"Nothing. No, your mom's just, uh... Feeling emotional."
Luke,"She was like this last month and the month before and the month before. Haley ; What?! I could kill someone! No, I can't hear you! This stupid phone gets no reception in this stupid house! Aah!"
Phil,"Dear God, no."
Phil,"I'd heard rumors. Yeah, we all had, that females living or working in close quarters could eventually get on the same... cycle. But I always assumed that was a story designed to keep women out of submarine corps."
Alex,This isn't milk. What's wrong with me today? My brain's not working right.
Phil,No.
Alex,I can't focus... Three legs?
Haley,It's not fair.
Claire,"I know. Oh, no! It's sad."
Luke,"Oh, my God. They're gonna ruin everything."
Phil,No. We... we just need to be extra sensitive.
Claire,"Phil, honey, when do we need to leave?"
Phil,"Whenever's good for you, sweetie. Maybe 20 minutes?"
Alex,20 minutes?!
Claire,"Then which one is it, Phil?"
Haley,Is it whenever it's good for me or is it 20 minutes?!
Phil,Whenever you're ready!
Phil,It happened... Satan's trifecta. The day I most dreaded has fallen on the day I most loved.
Luke,They're gonna ruin trapezing. I bet they don't even catch me.
Manny,"Why are you so afraid of them? They're reasonable. Why don't we just suggest they stay home, considering they're all on their menst..."
Phil,"Shh! The first rule of dealing with the cycle... you never mention the cycle. You tiptoe around it. The woman's actually taken great pains to hide the monster she's become. But if you acknowledge it, that brings the monster forth."
Luke,My God. And there's three of them.
Phil,"It's okay. I have a plan. It's kind of traditional for people to lean in when somebody says, ""I have a plan."" Okay..."
Gloria,"Si! Si! Si! Si! Goal! Goal! You should call your country ""the never- lands"" because you're never..."
Gloria,Why don't you Dutch people go home?
Gloria,"Okay, I wanna see you try!"
Jay,"Uh, is there a problem over here?"
Jay,"Really? Well, let me make a suggestion. Why don't you sit down, I send you over a beer, my wife and I watch from over there? That way, everybody enjoys the game... except me, 'cause I prefer a game where something happens. Gloria, let's go. Let's go."
Gloria,I thought you were going to punch that guy back there.
Jay,"Ah, I got 60 pounds on the kid."
Gloria,Yeah. It's just that I've heard so many stories about you fighting.
Jay,And... it's not worth the trouble.
Gloria,"Yeah, and he has all those friends and..."
Jay,"Well, his friends had nothing to do with it. I mean, sometimes it's better to take the high road."
Gloria,"Yeah, it's better that you walked away."
Jay,"Gloria, I get... I get the impression you're disappointed I didn't punch that guy."
Gloria,"Of course not. Who needs all that manly, protect-your-woman stuff?"
Jay,"No, see, like, right there. You're saying one thing, but it feels like you mean the opposite."
Gloria,No.
Jay,"That's a ""yes."""
Gloria,"Look, Jay, I just came to watch the game. I don't want to fight."
Jay,Neither do I.
Gloria,I know.
Mitchell,"Yeah. Oh, he's gonna love that."
Mitchell,"Oh, no! W-what is Cam doing home?"
Mitchell,"Yes, hi. Hi. Come on inside. Quickly, quickly. Hi. Okay, one second."
Mitchell,Hey! Whatcha doing home? Are you checking on me and the party again?
Cameron,"No, no. I left my cell phone in your car and I gotta be in touch with mama today. She's talking to the insurance agency for the first time to see if they're gonna rebuild grandpa's farm."
Mitchell,Rebuild the... Because of the tornado.
Mitchell,"I totally missed the connection. A month after the most devastating twister to ever hit Cam's hometown, I throw a party based on gay cinema's most famous tornado."
Cameron,"Yeah, you know, it's been a month, and she hasn't heard anything, and she's just beside herself. And then you know what else? Lily succumbed to her injuries."
Mitchell,Your aunt Lily died?
Cameron,"No, the family pig."
Mitchell,Aunt Lily was a... We named our daughter after a pig?
Cameron,"Could you just witness my pain instead of criticizing? I just want to be in touch with my family today, get all this tornado stuff behind me so I can enjoy... the fabulous party you're planning for me!"
Mitchell,"Yeah! You gotta get outta here! Okay. Hey, listen. Hey, Cam?"
Cameron,Yeah?
Mitchell,"You just call your family, tell them I said ""hi."" And don't worry"
Cameron,"Oh, what, are you kidding me?"
Mitchell,Mnh-mnh.
Cameron,"The sooner I can start to party, the sooner I can start to forget."
Mitchell,"But then again, hey, if you keep running from every reminder of the tornado, doesn't the tornado win?"
Cameron,"Mitchell, my grandpa runs to his pickup truck every morning because he thinks the pitchfork is gonna come back down. The tornado always wins."
Mitchell,"Okay, well, it's gonna be so much fun tonight!"
Cameron,I know! The big 1-0!
Mitchell,4-0!
Cameron,"Hey, Mitchell!"
Mitchell,I'm over here! But you didn't!
Cameron,I could've hit you!
Mitchell,"I'm doing my ""I love ya"" dance. Okay, I'm doing my ""I love you"" car dance."
Cameron,Look at you!
Mitchell,I do the best moves!
Cameron,Stop that!
Mitchell,"Okay! Go! I got... this is dangerous. Okay, okay. Go. Get out of here, you. Out!"
Cameron,It's my birthday!
Mitchell,"All right, guys, come here. We need to talk."
Manny,There they are.
Haley,Stop rushing us!
Phil,"Buddy, what's wrong?"
Manny,"Yes, you've been a little off all morning."
Luke,"I've been feeling a lot of stress lately. My head's all foggy, and I'm kind of emotional."
Phil,"Oh. Well, I sure hope you feel better soon 'cause you really need your wits about you when you're trapezing."
Claire,This is weird because the three of us haven't exactly been feeling our best today either.
Phil,Really?
Claire,Mm.
Alex,I can't find my other sock!
Haley,Try looking under the one you have one.
Alex,"I am not you. I don't do that. See? Oh, God, I am you."
Claire,Would you mind if we sat out trapezing?
Phil,Really?
Claire,Yeah.
Phil,Are you sure? Okay.
Claire,"Why does he do that? Every month. Yeah, I get a little moody, but unrelenting physical discomfort will do that to a person. Doesn't he know that tiptoeing around someone like they're crazy makes them crazy?"
Claire,"All right, you and Manny go ahead. Luke can just stay here with us."
Luke,Wait. What?
Phil,Luke's actually looking better.
Luke,I am better.
Claire,"Well, let's not take any chances. He can stay here. You go ahead."
Luke,Dad?
Phil,"Um, I..."
Luke,Daddy?
Phil,"See you later, buddy."
Manny,What are we going to do?
Phil,We leave no man behind.
Manny,I think I'm just gonna go home.
Mitchell,"Yeah, and throw a boring party in our house that looks like I just threw it together this afternoon? Think!"
Mitchell,Spilled juice on the owner's white rug and almost killed her toddler. Next.
Mitchell,Not classy enough. What have you got?
Mitchell,You're no help. You.
Mitchell,What's this boat? Tell me about the boat.
Mitchell,"Okay, okay. Uh, maybe we can... we can make a theme out of this. You know, Cam's life is like a long voyage. Sometimes choppy but... but always forward, ever forward."
Mitchell,Book it.
Jay,"Hey, you survived trapeze class, huh?"
Manny,"Didn't happen, and common decency prevents me from telling you why. How was the soccer match?"
Jay,Thrilling. 1-1 tie. One of the goals was an accident.
Manny,I'm sure my mom was happy you went.
Jay,"I don't know what to make of her today. She got into it with this guy, and I swear she was pushing me into a fight with him. Now is that something she'd want?"
Manny,"I don't know. I always thought of women as the more evolved sex. But after today... I've seen things, Jay."
Jay,"'Cause, you know, I had my share of fights in my time. You know that. Mmm! Mm. Mm. It's too warm for me. Yeah, I remember this time I was crossing the street with Dede, and some jackass almost clipped her. I had the guy on the ground, my foot on his neck, before the car stopped moving."
Manny,"Yeah, we've heard all those stories. Maybe my mom wouldn't mind a glimpse of that Jay. That's her. She wants me to help pick out Cam's gift."
Jay,"I'm still that guy, you know. 100%. What the hell? How do you cut your finger on a cracker? Anyway, if I thought there was a fight worth fighting, I'd fight it. Ow! Now I got salt in this. That stings!"
Gloria,"Next time, don't scream at your boss so that he doesn't make you work during the weekends. And you can come to see your son! Si. Adios."
Manny,"Hey, mom. Who were you yelling at?"
Gloria,"Your father, baby. He cannot make it this weekend."
Gloria,"Okay, I admit it. I wanted Jay to kick that little Dutch man's ass at the bar. But two seconds on the phone with Javier, and I remember what that stupid hothead behavior gets you... Nothing. It's better to be calm like Jay. Like Jay and me. Like Jay."
Phil,"I'm back! Wouldn't you know, I forgot my ding-dang sunglasses. Luke, could you give me a hand?"
Claire,What were the chances that Phil had come back to apologize for all the game playing and have an open conversation with me about what I was feeling?
Phil,"Okay, I got a bottle of fake blood out of the Halloween supplies. Put a dab on your finger, say you cut it. I say I need to run you by the doctor. Easy trapezy. Got it?"
Luke,"See ya on the other side, brother."
Claire,"Just once, I would like Phil to have a little empathy, give me some sense that he understands what women go through."
Phil,You feeling any better?
Claire,Mnh-mnh.
Phil,Hate to see the whole team on the D.L.
Luke,Ow! My finger!
Phil,I don't like the sound of that. I said a little bit!
Luke,The cap fell off. I decided to just go with it.
Phil,"Okay, we gotta get you out the back."
Alex,"God, what happened?!"
Phil,"Oh, it's just a little cut. But to be safe, I'll run him by the doctor."
Haley,"No, are you crazy?! Call 9-1-1!"
Phil,"No, no, they're so busy."
Haley,"Where's the wound?! We need to put pressure on it, right?"
Alex,I'm gonna be sick!
Haley,My... my finger.
Alex,"Oh, he needs a tourniquet! Where do I put it?!"
Luke,On my finger.
Claire,"Stop! There is nothing wrong with h.. Luke, what's going on?"
Luke,I cut my finger? Dad?
Phil,How crazy is that? They were in my pocket the whole time. I'll see you.
Claire,Phil!
Claire,"What is going on, Luke?"
Luke,Dad staged the whole thing so we could go on the trapeze without you three.
Claire,Why?
Luke,Because... B-because... Because of this! You're all monster-ating!
Phil,"Luke, no!"
Alex,Are you kidding me?!
Haley,"Oh, my God!"
Claire,"Oh, my lord."
Luke,"Sorry! I know you told me not to say it, but I..."
Claire,Phil! Is this what you've been teaching our son? That... that women are some kind of unclean lepers that should be hidden away under sheets for a week? Do you have any idea how offensive that is?
Phil,"I do, honey. And from the bottom of my heart, I am so... S-s-scared."
Alex,Ugh!
Claire,"Oh, my."
Mitchell,"Okay. 3, 2, 1!"
Cameron,"Oh, my gosh! Oh, it's amazing!"
Mitchell,"Yeah, it's a boat party."
Cameron,Oh! Because?
Mitchell,Your life is like a voyage.
Cameron,"Oh! Well, everyone's is, but I love it because none of our other friends have ever done it."
Phil,Aw. That's so sweet.
Claire,"Oh, it must be easy with no dirty, broken woman in the relationship."
Alex,What are you laughing at?
Mitchell,"Okay, everybody follow the birthday flag!"
Cameron,"What'd you call me? Oh. Uh, oh, yes. Oh, my gosh. It's so elegant. I'll bet Pepper is dying."
Mitchell,"Oh, you know, actually, Pepper couldn't come because he hates boats. You know, after the Navy."
Cameron,"Yeah. Oh, yeah. I guess longinus got over his fear of... of water?"
Mitchell,"No, no. Why don't we just focus on the 30 people who are here, having a great time!"
Gloria,Ew! It smells like somebody's dead.
Alex,Ugh! What is that smell?
Mitchell,"That faint odor is... is a tiny, tiny blue whale who apparently has indeed died, uh, nearby. But..."
Gloria,"Si, but it's getting all over my coat."
Phil,I don't smell anything. Maybe that's because you smell like a bouquet of flowers.
Claire,"Oh, yeah. Watch out for that."
Luke,Ugh! It smells like puke married poop and had the ceremony in my nose.
Manny,You paint with words.
Mitchell,"Okay, don't worry, everybody. Soon we'll be way, way out at sea, bouncing on the waves with all of his sweet-smelling brothers and sisters. Okay?"
Mitchell,"Oh, yes. Hi."
Mitchell,"No, no. I was... I was told you could take 30. I have exactly 30 guests."
Mitchell,Come on. There... there must be something that we can do here.
Gloria,": Please, um... What is the problem?"
Cameron,"Apparently, Mitchell started planning my birthday party two hours ago."
Mitchell,"Mnh-mnh. No. No, I-I did not. Uh, apparently, we have too many people for his boat. So..."
Gloria,That's crazy. I've seen more people clinging to a floating door.
Gloria,"Oh, no. You're going to have a safety issue if you don't take me away from this whale."
Jay,What's all this?
Cameron,"Uh, two hours of Mitchell's hard work going down the drain."
Jay,"Well, first of all, that ""lady"" is my son."
Mitchell,He wasn't talking about me.
Jay,"Oh. Her. Oh, it's ""her"" now. Well, ""her"" happens to be my wife. You got a problem with her, you got a problem with me."
Gloria,"No, no, Jay..."
Jay,You know...
Gloria,Calm down.
Jay,"No, your problem's about to get a lot bigger."
Gloria,"No, Jay, I know you think this is what I want, but it's not."
Jay,"I've got this, Gloria."
Gloria,"No, Jay. I was just being stupid today. I like that you're calm, that you think first, and you act second. I need that in my life."
Gloria,"Nobody call him ""grandpa""!"
Luke,I do.
Cameron,"Wait, w-wait. So no party now?"
Mitchell,"No! No, of course! Just... Just... just give me a minute okay?"
Cameron,"Oh, we, after what you did with two hours, I can't wait to see what you do with a minute."
Mitchell,Cam!
Phil,Poor Cam. He seems so upset.
Claire,"Oh, is that hard for you, Phil, that he's have a feeling around you?"
Haley,I'm so sorry.
Alex,Too many emotions?
Phil,"Okay, okay, I give up! Yeah, I made a mistake today. But only because the three of you ganged up on me like when the wolfman, Dracula, and frankenstein show up in the same movie, except this wasn't awesome! I have been on an emotional roller coaster all day today. I'm afraid. I'm mad. I'm mad because I'm afraid, and now I can't even think straight because I'm in so much pain from what just happened over there! And the whole thing makes me so sad, and I'm not even sure why, and I'm nauseous from that smell but I'm so hungry."
Claire,Yeah.
Mitchell,"Cam, the... the boat wasn't even part of the plan."
Cameron,"No, it's fine. It's my fault for letting my expectations get too high. I'll get over this one, too."
Mitchell,"No, no. I had this whole ""Wizard of Oz"" party planned, only today I realized that it might be a-a little too tornado-y."
Cameron,Today?
Mitchell,"Yes! I'm sorry I-I didn't make the connection, okay? Probably 'cause I've been planning for months so that you could have the perfect party and be happy, which now I don't even think is possible."
Cameron,"Oh, I'm sorry that I would like to have a nice 10th birthday party."
Mitchell,"Well, you can't have it, Cam! You wanna know why?! Because you're 40! You're a 40-year-old man!"
Cameron,I am 40. I'm 40.
Mitchell,"Yes. Oh, Cam, stop it."
Cameron,"I'm 40 and I'm... I'm on this stupid... wait, what is that?! Oh, it's this... Thing!"
Mitchell,"Suddenly, it all made sense. Cam's craziness all day wasn't about a party. It was about turning 40. And once he realized that, everything got much worse."
Cameron,I've done nothing with my life!
Mitchell,"Oh, w...stop it. Come on. How... how can you say that? You're... you're a wonderful father. You... You... you graduated from clown college. You've been to France."
Cameron,I don't want to be 40. It's not fair!
Phil,I know. Nothing's fair. 2 Miles from here is an amusement park full of happy families swinging on a trapeze. That's all I wanted for my special bonus day.
Cameron,What?
Mitchell,I'd been trying so hard to figure out what Cam wanted for his birthday. He'd been telling me all along. He wanted to be 10.
Phil,Seriously? There's nothing you can do?
Claire,How about you make an exception and strap him in there?
Haley,"Yeah, we're, like, ten minutes past your deadline, anyway."
Alex,And you don't want to make us angry today.
Claire,"""Ladies""?"
Alex,"Seriously, Pete?"
Haley,"No, I don't think ""ladies""..."
Phil,And that was how they apologized to me.
Haley,Whoo!
Claire,"Come on, Phil!"
Alex,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Ohh!"
Claire,"Oh, God, Phil!"
Haley,Aah! You did it!
Phil,"At least, I-I think it was. I could never ask them."
Claire,This is so satisfying!
Alex,Best I've felt all day!
Phil,Can I rent one of these on a monthly basis?
Mitchell,"Ohh, ha ha! Yes! Oh, yay!"
Cameron,Best 40th birthday party ever.
Mitchell,"No, no. 10th."
Cameron,Really?
Mitchell,"Yeah. In fact, you're still that sexy little 8 year old I fell in love with."
Cameron,"Oh, um..."
Mitchell,"No, just go."
Cameron,"This week, the world lost a great man, and I lost a mentor. For nearly 60 years, Professor ringmaster Al Uzielli helped young hopefuls like me find their clown persona."
Mitchell,"""Professor ringmaster""?"
Cameron,It's a very prestigious title at clown college. One step below piemaster general.
Cameron,Who knows?
Claire,"Hey, how come you guys haven't accepted my friend requests?"
Haley,I didn't know you were on Facebook.
Alex,Yeah. You said it was only for teenagers and people looking to have affairs.
Claire,"Well, I figured if you can't fight it... Not the having the affair. That's still bad. No. Not that, but there's nothing wrong with catching up with a few old friends, right? Or doing a little social networking with by B.F.F.s?"
Luke,Social networking or social not-working?
Claire,Oh! You know what we gotta do? We gotta get a picture of us all together on a boat. I think that's a thing now. So what do you say? Accept my friend thingy.
Alex,"Sorry, mom, I-I didn't get a friend thingy from you."
Haley,"Yeah, you know, they have a lot of blocks on there to protect kids from weirdos."
Claire,"Mm. Okay. Good, good. I'll send it again."
Haley,Great.
Alex,Please do.
Haley,"Please don't. We got her request the first time, but ignored it. I can't have her on there snooping around seeing what I'm doing at parties."
Alex,"Or posting pictures of us on family vacations wearing old, dorky clothes. What? What's wrong with this?"
Luke,"Dad, check it out. I made one giant oreo."
Phil,"Luke, what are you doing? You gotta eat it like it's an ear of corn."
Luke,Genius.
Phil,Aw.
Claire,Wow. New suit?
Phil,"New everything. Kids, gather 'round. It's time for a life lesson."
Haley,Aren't we already gathered?
Phil,"Let me tell you something. Hard work, determination, and perseverance always win out. I am living proof that nice guys can finish first."
Phil,Today I have a chance to get the biggest listing of my career.
Claire,"Oh, I have never seen this man so focused."
Phil,"I'm like a boxer before the big fight. That's why I didn't have sex with Claire last night. Sorry, honey."
Claire,Mm. It's... it's okay.
Phil,But as soon as I get this listing... ding!
Claire,Let's just stop. Stop.
Gloria,I see you.
Jay,What? I'm scratching.
Manny,"Hey, mom? Is it okay if I have a friend come over tomorrow?"
Gloria,Who? Reuben? Or the nervous one that gets the nosebleed?
Manny,It's Griffin Cooper.
Jay,Griffin Cooper?
Jay,"Griffin Cooper is, by far, the coolest kid in Manny's grade. He's a terrific athlete, he's confident. Manny's a great kid, sure, but he's not exactly cool. He can't even open a door cool."
Manny,"Salutations, Wyatt. I'm so glad you're joining me for an afternoon of mirth. Ah, good evening, Reuben-San. May I ask you to remove your shoes? Tonight, we are going Japanese. Ah! Hebalaboo ridabeley lai mubay rumboo. I invented a new language this morning."
Jay,When did you guys become buddies? Was it a football game in the yard? You made a great catch?
Manny,"No, that didn't happen. But the librarian told me one day I'll be a great catch."
Jay,I'm really not getting that relationship.
Gloria,Why can't you just be happy that Manny's making new friends?
Jay,No. 'Cause it doesn't add up. Cool kids like Griffin Cooper... they don't hang out with kids like Manny.
Gloria,Manny's very cool. Maybe those kids are finally catching up to him.
Jay,"Wait a minute. I get it. Couple of days last week, I took Manny to school on my motorcycle. Griffin must think I'm pretty boss."
Gloria,"Yes, Jay. It's all because of you."
Jay,Kids are looking for role models. Why do you think fonzie was so popular?
Gloria,"He told people that they were rich, but really took their money with his scheme?"
Jay,"No, that's a... Yes. Those people were victims of a fonzie scheme."
Gloria,Mm.
Phil,It's showtime !
Phil,Mitzi.
Phil,"Mitzi Roth... a notorious poacher in the world of high-end residential real estate. We call her the ""nightmare on elm street,"" because she sold a lot of houses on elm street."
Phil,"What are you doing here, Mitzi? I have an appointment. This is my listing."
Phil,"Really? Okay, but could you come back later? I really need to have them to myself right now."
Phil,"Okay, thanks."
Phil,Wait. What? What are you doing?
Phil,And Phil Dunphy.
Phil,"Hey, Stan! Hey, Patti!"
Phil,We've got a lot to talk about.
Phil,"Um... Hey, guys. Yeah. I'm wondering if maybe we shouldn't be alone for this."
Phil,Hey. How are you guys?
Phil,"Well, good to... good to see you, Mitzi. Guys, how are you?"
Phil,"Mitzi, please! Mitzi, please! Please! What are you doing?"
Phil,What?!
Phil,I don't have an anger... I don't... anger problem. I don't have an anger problem.
Cameron,"Hello, Lewis."
Cameron,"For several years, I was one half of the renowned clown duo Fizbo & Lewis. We were huge."
Mitchell,In children's parties.
Cameron,"Anyway, I disbanded the group shortly after I met Mitchell. It's hard to have a relationship and a clown career. That's the reason there are so many single clowns."
Mitchell,Just one of the reasons.
Cameron,"Anyway, um, Lewis hasn't spoken to me since. He's still bitter, and I don't blame him. It's kind of like I broke up The Beatles."
Mitchell,Of children's parties.
Cameron,"I should, you know, probably go. You know, for... for Al."
Mitchell,"Oh, yeah, no, of course. But, hey, listen, don't let him get to you, all right?"
Cameron,"No. It's fine. It's all seltzer under the bridge. Just one drink, and then I'll be home."
Mitchell,Okay. Just drive me home first?
Cameron,"No, you, uh, you... you take the car. I, uh, I'll go with the guys."
Mitchell,In that tiny car? How are you all possibly gonna... Forget I asked!
Mitchell,It's 5:00 in the morning.
Mitchell,"Lily, honey, what are you doing up? Are you just getting home?"
Cameron,"Yeah, things got a little out of hand. Somebody had a flower that squirted Tequila."
Mitchell,Really?
Cameron,And don't forget the importance of balance! Oh!
Mitchell,Okay. Okay. Come on.
Cameron,I think I cracked my eggs.
Mitchell,"Lily, don't ever do that."
Claire,"Okay. You two are deliberately not confirming me. Everybody else has accepted my Facebook requests... Your father, Uncle Mitchell... Adele. That's right. Adele has agreed to be my friend, and my own daughters haven't."
Alex,"Yeah, you may just be a fan of Adele, and..."
Claire,What is so private that I can't possibly see it?
Haley,Nothing.
Claire,"Nothing. You just don't want to be my friend. Great. I can see my next status update... ""My daughters are monsters."""
Phil,You're not gonna believe this. Mitzi got the listing.
Claire,"Oh, no, honey. That's awful."
Phil,"She cheated, she lied, and she won. Kids, gather 'round."
Haley,"Again, we are gathered."
Phil,"You wanna get ahead? Don't play by the rules. Turns out nice guys finish last in this cold, dog-eat-dog world."
Luke,"It's not fair. Why don't you play dirty, too? You could take her down."
Claire,"Honey, 'cause your dad is a better man than that. He has values and morals and..."
Phil,"Shh. You. Keep talking. Well, just off the top of my head, you could take my spy pen and record her admitting what she did. And then you could play it for those people so they realize what a jerk she is."
Claire,Your dad is never gonna do that...
Phil,You're a regular chatterbox today! Get me that pen!
Manny,I got it!
Jay,"Remember, pal, keep it simple."
Manny,"Griffin... legendary creature of Greek mythology with the head of a lion and wings of an eagle. What'd you say, Jay?"
Jay,Never mind. Jay Pritchett. Nice to meet you.
Jay,"You know, I, uh, I saw a little of that basketball game of yours last week. You were lightin' it up."
Manny,"I was lighting it up, too, Jay."
Manny,Who's hot? We're hot! Mustangs are hot! Hey!
Gloria,"Hola, Griffin. How are you?"
Gloria,So what do you boys have planned for today?
Manny,"Well, it's kind of a surprise for Griffin, but let's just say it involves decoupage."
Jay,"Oh, jeez."
Manny,Come on. Let's go.
Gloria,"Oh, no."
Jay,What?
Gloria,You were right. This boy is not here to see Manny.
Jay,I told you. You see the way he looks at me?
Gloria,"No, fonzie, the way he looks at me. He couldn't talk. He kept staring. He was just like my teachers back in school."
Jay,"Gloria, you're very pretty. But the kid idolizes me."
Gloria,"Really? Griffin! Manny! Do you want to go with Jay to ride his motorcycle, or you want to go with me to the supermarket and buy a couple of onions?"
Manny,Motorcycle rides!
Jay,"Huh. Guess he has a thing for you, too."
Cameron,Hey! We're back!
Mitchell,"Hey, I-I just finished cleaning the kitchen, so if anyone has to do a spit take, please do it over the sink."
Mitchell,"What... what's the deal with this? I open it up and snakes fly out, or a fire?"
Cameron,Yeah.
Mitchell,"No. No. That's exactly what I expected. 'Member, when I told you?"
Mitchell,"I'm sor... excuse me. ""White up""?"
Cameron,"Oh, yeah. Lewis got a call to do a birthday party this afternoon, so we're gonna put the old act back together."
Mitchell,Said. Hoped. Could I talk to you for a second?
Mitchell,"Please tell me ""smokes"" is not another clown, 'cause I don't think I could handle another one of him."
Cameron,"Oh, Lewis is not that bad."
Mitchell,"Well, what do you see in that guy, Cam?"
Cameron,"I don't know. Maybe the fact that he doesn't roll his eyes every time I talk about the art of clowning... Like that. He may have had his faults, but we were great together. We had an unspoken language. We finished each other's balloon animals. But you would never know, because you have never been to one of our performances."
Mitchell,Birthday parties.
Cameron,You hate my clown side.
Mitchell,No. No. No. I don't hate it.
Cameron,Just admit it. I basically already know you do.
Mitchell,Okay. Okay. Cards on the table. It's not my favorite thing that you...
Cameron,"Oh, how dare you? I am a clown. It's who I am! If you squeeze me, do I not honk? Eye roll!"
Mitchell,"Oh, like I had a choice!"
Phil,"Knock, knock."
Phil,"Hey, um, I-I brought you some... soup. You know, I thought about it, and maybe I did push you. So... how's the ankle?"
Phil,So that was all a ruse?
Phil,None at all.
Phil,Because I just recorded your entire confession... Right here on my...
Phil,Um...
Jay,Ah. Thank you.
Manny,"Hey, mom. Guess what? Griffin invited us all over to his house for a pool party and barbecue tonight."
Jay,"Pool party, huh?"
Manny,"Yeah, and he said bring your swimsuits. He was pretty adamant about it."
Jay,It's 50 degrees outside.
Gloria,Sounds fun.
Manny,Great. I'll call him.
Jay,"You know, you're basically agreeing to a date with a 13-year-old boy."
Gloria,"Jay, we use this go get us tables at restaurants, why can't we use this to get Manny a friend?"
Jay,Because he's not really getting a friend.
Gloria,"Oh, but when you thought that he was trying to ride your motorcycle, it was okay."
Jay,Maybe now I don't like what he's trying to ride.
Gloria,"Manny likes Griffin. Maybe someday, if they spend enough time together, Griffin will like Manny."
Manny,What? Griffin doesn't like me?
Gloria,"No, no, no, papi. He loves you."
Manny,But you just said someday Griffin will like me. That means he doesn't like me now.
Jay,"You know what, kid? We think that Griffin might be hanging out with you because he's got a little crush on your mother and me."
Gloria,On you?
Manny,Wow. I can't believe it.
Jay,"Listen, it's fine. You're gonna be fine. Okay?"
Gloria,I'm sorry.
Manny,Are you kidding? It's fantastic!
Jay,How is it fantastic?
Manny,I'm only hanging out with him because I have the hots for his sister Chloe. You've met Griffin. The kid's a doorknob.
Gloria,So you're just using him?
Manny,"Yeah, and I felt really guilty about it until now. Now it's a win-win."
Gloria,Not for me!
Manny,"Just suck it up, mom. I've done a lot for you over the years. Jay, you, too. This girl could be the one. Then I'm out of your hair forever. Pool party, mom. Dress accordingly."
Luke,Can you help me reach that box of cereal?
Luke,Hey. You're Mitzi Roth. I recognize you from your ads.
Luke,I'm Luke Dunphy. My dad's Phil Dunphy.
Luke,Why do you hate him so much?
Luke,"Well, it's personal to us. I've never seen my dad so worried before. I have this spy pen, and I heard him talking to my mom, and he's scared about paying for my sister's college next year. And I guess he's nervous about some kind of party, because he said there's a big balloon payment. Anyways, he's like the best dad ever, so maybe you could be a little nicer to him."
Phil,"There you are, buddy. Check it out. They're giving away free jelly beans. Hey, Mitzi."
Phil,He's mine.
Cameron,"Hey, so I was thinking after, uh, little Fizbo, we could do the ladder bit."
Cameron,What's next weekend?
Cameron,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I-I can't do that."
Cameron,"We're taking Lily to the aquarium next weekend. You know, Lewis, this was just a onetime thing, right?"
Cameron,"Well, that was just for today."
Cameron,I'm... I'm sorry if you thought...
Cameron,"You got it, partner."
Cameron,"Hello, big people!"
Cameron,"Let's get this party started! Wow, all this dancing sure has made me hungry! Wish I had something to eat! Heh! Oh! Oh, forgot I had that fish over there. Don't know why he's so mad at me! He was fine just a minute ago. Ohh! Okay! Somebody's a little punchy today! Oh. Hey. What's the frying pan doing here? When did we add a frying pan to the act? We don't need... Nope! Don't need the frying pan! Ow! Oh, gosh! Why are you doing that? Stop doing that."
Cameron,"Ow! That hurts! Seriously, stop it!"
Cameron,"Somebody! Somebody! This isn't pretend! Someone grab an adult, please!"
Phil,Mitzi.
Phil,You drove all the way over here for this?
Phil,What?
Phil,Thank you so much.
Phil,Oh. You did.
Phil,I'm so sorry. But thank you.
Phil,"Kids, gather 'round!"
Haley,We are right here!
Phil,"Oh. Let me tell you something... people are fundamentally good. The key is, you find that goodness deep within 'em. Twist it, and turn it to your advantage. Hello. Psh!"
Phil,And... there she is. What are you gonna hit?
Luke,"College, balloon payment, greatest dad ever."
Phil,Nice. Do you want me to squirt some tears in your eyes?
Luke,"Dad, please. I was fake crying before I could walk. How do you think I got out of eating all those salads? Can you help me reach that box of cereal? Oh, hey. You're Mitzi Roth, right? I recognize you from your ads."
Claire,I can't believe you got that listing back!
Phil,Sweetheart!
Claire,Honey! Oh.
Phil,Honey?
Claire,Mm-hmm?
Phil,Ding?
Claire,You sure you wanna ding a chatterbox? Mnh-mnh.
Phil,"Honey... Buddy, quick... What's the trick to those fake tears?"
Luke,The three stooges are all dead.
Phil,"Yeah, that's good."
Claire,"Well, it looks like somebody likes Coldplay."
Alex,Mm. Right. You saw.
Claire,Uh-huh. Did you see the pictures I posted from Thanksgiving? Totes adorbs.
Haley,I'm going to kill myself.
Claire,Hmm. You gotta check out my wall. Right there.
Haley,"""Spring break, 1990, New Orleans."" Is that you?"
Claire,What?
Haley,Some guy from your college tagged you in a picture.
Claire,"What is ""tagging""? What is ""tagging""?"
Alex,Why are you drinking out of a funnel?
Haley,And why is his hand on your...
Claire,Untag it!
Haley,"Oh, my goodness!"
Claire,"Un... untag it! Girls, I'm serious! Untag it! Tear down the wall!"
Phil,"Councilwoman Dunphy, how do you respond to allegations that you look super sexy in your new suit?"
Claire,"Uh, I haven't been elected yet. Come on, kids! We gotta vote! Honey, come on. Please stop filming."
Phil,"I'm just excited! After today, you are going to be a councilwoman, and I am going to be a first husband."
Claire,"And if you don't stop filming, you're going to be my first husband. All right, everybody, come on! Do you know what you're doing, kids? You guys are manning the phone banks. Alex, you're in charge of that."
Haley,Wh-why is she in charge? And what's... what's a phone bank?
Alex,That's why.
Claire,Phil.
Phil,"I got it. I will be driving 50 of our finest senior citizens to the polls, assuming, of course, that they remember that I'm coming for them. Where you at?"
Luke,High-five. Old people occasionally forget things.
Claire,"Okay. All right, everybody, let's go. Let's go."
Phil,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Real quick! Sorry. Everybody get in there. Jump in there. I just want to say how proud of you we all are. You're an inspiration. Who would have thought that 20 years ago when you were still in the bloom of your youth..."
Claire,"Okay, I'm gonna go start the car."
Jay,"Claire likes to win. When she was 8, a little girl scout friend of hers bragged she could sell the most cookies. Damn if Claire didn't walk the neighborhood till she got blisters on her feet and won by ten boxes. Best part is Claire wasn't even a girl scout."
Cameron,The choice is Claire! Vote Claire Dunphy for town council.
Claire,"Aw, I love it!"
Mitchell,"What do you think, huh?"
Claire,I love it.
Mitchell,We got it on Craigslist. Came off a taco truck.
Cameron,It did.
Claire,I love that you're doing this for me. Thank you!
Cameron,You're welcome. Mitchell ! I know how important winning is to Claire.
Cameron,And I love to festoon things.
Mitchell,We're her dream team.
Cameron,"So we cleared the whole day, dropped Lily off at school, and voted first thing."
Mitchell,"Although, uh, one of us had a bit of a dimpled chad situation."
Cameron,"Can you tell me how this machine works again, Chad?"
Cameron,Just wanna look in here. Just...
Claire,Thank you. Thank you.
Phil,Bye! Bye!
Claire,"Thank you, guys!"
Cameron,I can see Clairely now that Duane is gone.
Claire,"Bye! Thank you! Oh, my gosh. Okay, everybody, get in the car. Let's go. Let's go."
Claire,"Oh, Laurie, thank you."
Claire,"Oh, congratulations!"
Haley,This whole waiting-to-hear thing has been a nightmare since the very first letter.
Haley,I'm too nervous. I can't do it.
Alex,"""Dear miss Dunphy, we regret to inform you..."""
Haley,What?! Don't leave me hanging!
Haley,"After that, I decided to only tell my parents good news. I have one school left, and the only good news I've gotten is that my annoying neighbor Becky is moving back east to Oregon."
Jay,"Manny, write this down."
Manny,I didn't bring a pen.
Jay,"Election day is America at its finest. The people speak, and the government listens. I don't know what they do in Colombia."
Gloria,"No one does, and don't ask."
Jay,"I mean, we know that voting's a privilege, but for my daughter to have her name on that ballot, it just means so much more... You know what? I think I'm gonna vote later."
Gloria,What? Where are you going?
Jay,"Ah, the line is too long."
Gloria,It's only three people! And nobody has a gun!
Cameron,"We're here, we're Claire, get used to it!"
Mitchell,"You know, I'm not sure if that's tracking. Here, let me try one. You don't have to be Clairevoyant to know who to vote for. Vote Dunphy for town council. Uh, uh, uh, Claire Dunphy. Uh, C-Claire's her first name. I'm sorry if that wasn't Claire."
Cameron,"Oh, my God. Look at that. There's a trash can right there, and that guy just threw his paper on the sidewalk. Hey! You in the yellow jacket. Pick it up and put it in the trash."
Mitchell,"Oh, my God. He did it."
Cameron,"Yes, he did."
Mitchell,"Ooh, here. Let me try one. I'll try... Hey, dragon tattoo, no jaywalking!"
Cameron,"oh, my gosh. This is an instrument of power. How could they not sell tacos?"
Mitchell,"You know what we could do with this thing? Cam, we could really make a difference. We could be the voice of change."
Cameron,"Ooh, I got it! Let's go yell at the dry cleaner that lost my shirt."
Phil,"Come on, gang. Today is the Dunphys at their best."
Claire,Not at all. Fire away.
Claire,Claire Dunphy.
Claire,Uh... Because I am Claire Dunphy.
Claire,Not as good as I did a few minutes ago.
Phil,"No, she feels great. Um, her spirits are high. The whole family's high. There's your headline."
Claire,"Phil, no."
Claire,Yeah. Sure. Yes.
Alex,"Mom, mom, mom. Tag. Tag's still on."
Claire,"Oh, my Goodness. Thank you. That would have been a really awkward picture. Okay. No!"
Alex,What is that? Is that a tooth?
Haley,Ew!
Luke,Awesome!
Haley,How old are you?
Claire,No!
Luke,Do it again!
Alex,How does that even happen?
Claire,"It's a-a fake tooth from an old ice-skating injury. It just fell out. Oh, my gosh. Why today?! What about the..."
Phil,Let's not overreact. Let's... let me see it.
Claire,Okay. All right.
Gloria,What happened back there?
Jay,"Line was too long. I couldn't wait. I've seen you wait 45 minutes in line for sherbet! Well, I happen to like sherbet, okay? That place I take you has the greatest sherbet on the west coast. They got lime sherbet, they got coconut sherbet."
Gloria,Why are we talking about sherbet?
Manny,He's clearly changing the subject.
Jay,Why aren't you in school?
Manny,He's doing it again.
Gloria,Manny's right. You're being very ardilla.
Jay,"""Ardilla""?"
Gloria,"Yeah, you know, the... The one that... that..."
Jay,Rabbit? I was being rabbit-y?
Gloria,"No, another one with the cheeks and the tail and..."
Jay,Chipmunk? Possum?
Manny,"Okay, obviously she means squirrel. You were being squirrely then, you're being squirrely now."
Jay,Better than being a rat.
Gloria,"Manny, give us a minute."
Manny,"Oh, sure. I served him up on a silver platter."
Jay,"What? All right, it's no big deal. There was a woman working there. I didn't want her to see me."
Gloria,Who is she?
Jay,Her name is Dottie. She's the first woman I dated after my divorce.
Gloria,You dated a Dottie after Dede?
Jay,"Y-you're focusing on the wrong thing here. The... the point is it ended badly. I tried to let her down easy, but, uh, she didn't take it too well."
Jay,"Actually, I don't know how she took it, 'cause I wasn't there. We dated a few weeks, then after we... You know, I slipped out of her house before she woke up and never called her again. Put my pants on in her yard, put the car in neutral, let it roll down the driveway, lights off. Hey, I can't talk about this anymore."
Gloria,"So because of this woman, you didn't vote for your daughter? It's Claire! We need her to win! I don't want to be around when something that tight comes unraveled."
Jay,I'll figure out something. Maybe those poll workers take shifts.
Gloria,"Stop hiding in your little cave like a... Like, you know. Like the... the... the..."
Jay,I really don't wanna do this again.
Gloria,"No, the... No. No. The big one, like, uh, the monster furry one. Ay, why can't I remember any animal names?"
Phil,Climb aboard the Dunphy Express. Next stop... democracy.
Phil,Please don't go. I won't do that anymore. I promise.
Phil,"No can do. I, uh... I got a lot of people waitin', so..."
Phil,"Yeah, I... I don't think it's mandatory, Walt."
Cameron,"They will break all your buttons... and say you brought it in that way. Okay, go, go, go!"
Mitchell,Turns out we had a lot of axes to grind.
Cameron,"And a hybrid, so there was virtually no stopping us."
Mitchell,Do not see that movie! You will neither laugh nor cry!
Cameron,"""Best pizza in the city""? Not even the best pizza on this street."
Mitchell,They do not do the hair of the people on those pictures!
Cameron,"""Totally free checking""? Don't bank on it!"
Mitchell,"Okay, that was really fun, but now we gotta go back to campaigning for Claire."
Cameron,We've been saying that for two hours.
Mitchell,"Yes, but now I-I really mean it. Oh, my god, there's Sandy!"
Cameron,Sandra Bullock?
Mitchell,"Yeah, Sandra Bullock. We're such good friends, I call her ""Sandy,"" So... No, Sandy who works at Lily's preschool. Right there."
Cameron,"Oh, yeah. You know, she got engaged."
Mitchell,No! To the gay boyfriend?
Cameron,Totally.
Mitchell,"Oh, how does she not see it?"
Cameron,"If I was with somebody that gorgeous, I'd overlook a few quirks, too."
Mitchell,"First of all, thank you. Second of all... point well taken. I don't know. Poor Sandy. I feel so bad for her."
Cameron,"Well, it's better than being alone."
Mitchell,Is it?
Cameron,She's looking over here.
Mitchell,"Oh, my god."
Cameron,"Mitchell, you're sitting on the button."
Mitchell,"What? No... no, I'm not. No, I'm not! The... it's stuck! And you're the one that had it last when you were talking to the cheese shop!"
Cameron,"Because you know what? If you advertise truffle cheese, there are certain expectations..."
Mitchell,"Hi, Sandy."
Gloria,"Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Claire Dunphy."
Manny,What a beautiful name.
Alex,She used to be a citizen.
Manny,I'm calling on behalf of Claire Dunphy for town council.
Luke,All right. How about this? If you vote for Claire Dunphy... You won't have to pay taxes for the rest of your life.
Alex,Vote for Claire! Luke! What are you doing? You can't say that!
Luke,"Oh, like she'd be the first politician to make a promise she can't keep."
Gloria,"Well, maybe I don't want to talk to you, either. Maybe you are the one that is bothering me! How do you like that? Eh?"
Alex,"Gloria, I'm gonna have to ask you again to please stick to your script."
Gloria,"But everybody's saying no to me! I don't get it. Usually when I ask someone to do something, they just do it!"
Alex,Maybe it's because these people can't see you.
Gloria,I don't like it. Can't you just hook me up to some sort of camera?
Manny,"Well, thank you, Maggie, for the vote. Okay. Bye-bye."
Claire,"Thank you. Um, you'll have to excuse me. I'm a little nervous. I've never been on the radio before."
Claire,Okay.
Claire,Okay.
Claire,Oh. Cell phone. Right. Um...
Claire,"No, I'm not. I just had some temporary dental work done. The last thing I need..."
Claire,"Thank you, Cecil. It's a pleasure to be here."
Claire,"It all started with a, um... With a stop sign. I was concerned about safety in our neighbourhood and I was not getting any satisfaction from city hall."
Luke,What's wrong with mom?
Alex,"Oh, this isn't good."
Gloria,She sounds drunk!
Haley,That's not her drunk voice.
Claire,One cannot really talk about s-s-sewage and sustainability without first discussing... recycling. This city can do more...
Claire,With the recycling program...
Claire,...currently...
Phil,It's a tooth thing. What's wrong?
Phil,Is that serious?
Phil,You know what? I lost a ton of time getting your glasses. I'm just gonna drop you at home. You can get your air. I can drive other people.
Phil,Why? That seems like bad planning.
Phil,Please tell me you have it with you.
Phil,Are you asking me?
Phil,"Okay, I'll get you whatever you want! I'll get you the air, I'll get you the food."
Phil,That is not her drunk voice!
Jay,"Hi. I'm terribly sorry. Excuse me. Jay Pritchett. Uh, can I get in... in and out really quick? Thank you. This is all I needed. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. All right. Claire, Claire, Claire. Claire, Claire... ahh, ahh. Here. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Hello, Dottie!"
Jay,Is it?
Jay,"Oh, that's great."
Jay,You remember my daughter Claire. She's... She's running for town council.
Jay,"Yeah, I'm so proud. So you're gonna put it in there, huh?"
Jay,"Cause every vote counts, you know."
Jay,You know...
Jay,"Boy, I'd sure like to see the sweet sight of my vote... counting."
Jay,"Okay, here it is. Look, I am so sorry. You were the first woman I'd been with besides my ex... 35 years. I panicked. An-and it wasn't 'cause y-you weren't pretty naked or anything like that. I'd have run from Angie Dickinson."
Jay,Dottie...
Jay,"Dottie, Dottie, please. I'm just trying to get my ballot in the box."
Jay,"Yeah, but you don't have to do anything. Just let me put it in! Uhh. Shouldn't have said that."
Cameron,We are so sorry. We did not mean for you to hear any of that.
Mitchell,"Yes, and you know what? We shouldn't have been gossiping in the first place."
Cameron,Means nothing.
Mitchell,No.
Cameron,"We barely know your fiance. If he says he's straight, he's straight."
Mitchell,Mm. Straight.
Mitchell,"Oh, my god! No. No, no, no. Hey. This is what gays do. We gossip."
Cameron,We gossip a lot.
Mitchell,"No. No. You're missing the point, okay? We see a great-looking guy like Gregory, and we say he's gay because we want him to be gay!"
Mitchell,Yes.
Cameron,Yes. Absolutely. Look at what we do with movie stars.
Mitchell,Okay.
Cameron,"You know? Hugh Jackman... he sings, he dances, he's dreamy! So obviously we would want him on our team! But he's straight. Trust me, I know. I said hello to him once in a restaurant, and there was absolutely no chemistry."
Mitchell,"Well, if that isn't proof..."
Cameron,"Three weeks later, Sandy and Gregory got married, and everyone said the wedding was beautiful."
Mitchell,Gregory did the flowers.... Which is perfectly normal for a straight guy.
Phil,All right. Let's go vote.
Phil,"You heard her. She wanted to put up a stop sign at Bristol and Greenleaf, But then she ran into..."
Phil,Yeah. We're neighbors. Let's go!
Phil,You don't even drive!
Phil,I don't think he was involved in the decision! I left the house today to get 50 votes for my wife. I'm not going home with zero. The least you can do is walk right in there and punch a hole for the woman who drags your garbage can up your driveway every Tuesday!
Phil,Really? A stop sign?!
Phil,So sorry. Thank you. Here you go.
Phil,Okay. Let's just go vote.
Claire,"Hi, everyone!"
Alex,Any news?
Claire,"Not yet, not yet, but even if I lose, at least now I know I have a future in radio."
Gloria,I couldn't. People need to see me.
Claire,"Before we get the results, I just want to thank you all for everything you've done for me. Mitch and Cam, for campaigning for me all day in your little Claire-mobile."
Cameron,It's the least we could do.
Cameron,Literally
Mitchell,We probably did more for Hugh Jackman's career than we did for Claire's.
Claire,"And, Manny and Gloria, thank you for making all those phone calls. And, dad... for all your support."
Gloria,I don't think I convinced anyone to vote for Claire.
Jay,I don't think I even voted.
Claire,And my husband... who drove around I don't know how many senior citizens today to the polls.
Phil,One.
Claire,"And my beautiful children, whose faith has given me the confidence to believe that I can do this. I can... oh. Somebody else answer it. I lost."
Alex,Mom. Mom.
Claire,I can feel it. I...
Alex,Mom. You can do it. Mom. Answer the phone.
Claire,Hello? This is she. Thanks so much for calling. Bye-bye. I have some bad news.
Phil,Because someone's gonna be busy now that she's a councilwoman?
Claire,"No, no, I wasn't doing that fake thing. I really lost. I lost."
Gloria,"Ay, no."
Phil,I'm so sorry. But you know what? We are still just so proud of you.
Claire,"Yeah! I... I don't know about you, But, um... I could use a glass of wine."
Luke,Ohh. Now you're gonna hear her drunk voice.
Haley,Mom? You okay?
Claire,"Yes. Fine. I'm good. I'm fine. I'm not fine. I wanted to win, And... and I'm so embarrassed. I mean, everybody out here worked so hard for me, and they believed in me, and I let 'em down. Oh, honey. Oh, sweetheart. Well, don't cry. I'm gonna be fine, sweetie. Really, I am. Just knowing you care so much makes me feel better."
Haley,"No, I got four rejection letters I never told you guys about."
Claire,What?
Haley,"I got rejected from U.C.S.B., Oregon, Wisconsin..."
Claire,"Oh, no."
Haley,And Northwestern.
Claire,"Well, we were overshooting on that one. What about, uh..."
Haley,It came today. My last chance. I'm too scared to open it.
Claire,"Whatever it says in there, your father and I are crazy proud of you. Okay?"
Haley,I did start trying this year.
Claire,I know you did. You did. You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Haley,Neither do you.
Claire,It's a little bit different.
Haley,"No, it's exactly the same. Except you tried really hard the whole time, not just at the end."
Claire,You're right. It is the same. We have nothing to be ashamed of... so let's open that together.
Phil,"Yeah, open it."
Haley,What? No! What are you doing here?
Mitchell,"No. Come on, Haley. We believe in you."
Alex,Do it!
Jay,You can always work for me.
Alex,Come on. You can do it. You can do this.
Claire,"Come on, Haley."
Phil,All right.
Haley,"""Dear Miss Dunphy, we regret to inform you..."""
Phil,"Oh, honey."
Haley,"""While we cannot offer you admission at this time, you are a promising candidate, and therefore we would like to place you on our wait list!"" Oh, my god, I got wait-listed!"
Claire,We will take it!
Gloria,Congratulations! Congratulations!
Phil,Our daughter might be going to college!
Claire,"Phil, look. A stop sign."
Phil,It's addressed to you.
Claire,"""Dear Claire, I won. You lost. Here's your stupid stop sign. Next time you think about bothering me, please take its advice. Your councilman, the honorable Duane Bailey."""
Phil,"Honey, you did it!"
Claire,"I did it. I made our neighborhood a little bit safer. I may have even saved life. You idiot, there's stop sign! Can't you read? we need speed bumps."
Phil,"No, no. No! Honey!"
Claire,We have to tell him.
Phil,I hope he's okay.
Claire,"Walt, our elderly next door neighbor, died. He and Luke were pretty close, so we have to tell him. I'm a little nervous about it."
Phil,I think we should break it to him slowly.
Claire,Like how?
Phil,"Well, first we'd say, ""Luke, your friend Walt has a cold. You shouldn't go over there."" Next day... ""bad news. Walt's in the hospital,"" but he's still cracking jokes with the nurses."" Next day... ""they're trying an experimental drug."" Fingers crossed."" Next day... ""his body rebelled. He's in a coma."" Next day... he rallies, next day... coma, next day... coma, next day... coma, next day... eye flutter..."
Claire,Stop. Just stop. Stop. Oh.
Claire,"Oh, Luke, we have some bad news for you. It's about Walt. I'm afraid... he passed away."
Phil,"Um, it happened yesterday. He finished writing an angry letter to the postmaster general, and he just fell asleep."
Luke,Okay.
Phil,"It was very peaceful. Not the letter. That was full of threats, but..."
Claire,"It's okay to be sad, honey. You two were really good friends. It must be quite a shock to hear that... Walt's dead."
Phil,"Um, so do you wanna talk about it or..."
Luke,I'm okay. Can I get back to my video game? It's paused.
Phil,"Oh, um, sure. Yeah, buddy. Come here."
Claire,How weird was that?
Phil,I know. Crazy weird.
Claire,It's like he had no feelings at all.
Phil,I'm more worried about the one you showed. What's with all the smiling?
Claire,What are you talking about?
Phil,"That grin. ""Walt's dead."" You looked like the joker."
Claire,I didn't smile.
Phil,You did. It's like a weird coping mechanism. You did the same thing when you told him his hamster died.
Claire,"I don't know what you thought you saw, Phil, but our child just got some terrible news and had absolutely no reaction. Doesn't that concern you?"
Phil,Yeah. He probably just needs time to process it.
Claire,Hmm. Do you think?
Phil,"Yeah, honey. Death is a profound thing to deal with at any age. We all manage it differently. Some people lock up their feelings. Others... reach out for comfort, finding some way to reaffirm their connection to life..."
Claire,You're joking.
Phil,Oh.
Gloria,"Hola, Haley."
Haley,"Gloria, I was driving by and saw this outside your door, so here."
Gloria,Thank you.
Haley,"No problem. Hey, so since I'm already here, my friend was gonna have a pool party tonight, but he got sick. Could we have it here?"
Gloria,"Mm. Good thing that you saw this paper or if not, you would have never been able to ask."
Haley,Yeah.
Gloria,"I'm sorry, but Jay and I are going to Mitch and Cam's for dinner tonight."
Haley,I'm just thinking out loud here. What if I get a chaperone that my parents approve of? Would it be okay then?
Gloria,"Well, I guess so. You know, it would be good for Manny to have a little bit of fun. Do you mind if he stays here for the party?"
Haley,Mind? The plan depended on him.
Claire,I don't suppose you've thought of a chaperone?
Haley,"Of course not, mom, because it's going to be a wild party and I'm trying to get away with something, as usual. Yes, I thought of a chaperone... my Uncle who already said he would do it. But if that's gonna be a problem, I think I should just call everybody..."
Claire,Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. It's fine.
Haley,"And thank you, Uncle Manny."
Cameron,Can you help a little bit?
Mitchell,"This... if I... if I push down, does that..."
Cameron,"Yeah, that's helping. That's helping."
Mitchell,"No, it's not helping. It's 'cause it's stuck."
Cameron,"I can't believe I got 'em this stuck. I've built beds my whole life... bunk beds, dog beds, cow beds."
Mitchell,"Okay, I'm calling you on cow beds."
Cameron,"Oh, that's my dad! Okay. He can help. He's built a boat, a dock, a lake..."
Mitchell,"Uh, he did not build a lake. Okay, from now on, just stop after you say the second thing."
Cameron,"Yeah, well, I hate to admit it, but it throws me, too. I do prefer a man."
Mitchell,"Hey, Merle. Hey. How are you?"
Mitchell,"Okay. Nice to see you. All right, let me grab that for you."
Cameron,"Oh, yeah. Coming right up. And you know where everything is. Go have a seat."
Mitchell,"Oh, I missed a call from my dad."
Cameron,"Oh, let me guess. Is he calling to cancel? What's his excuse this time?"
Mitchell,"You know, that's a really mean thing to assume, Cam. I really wish you'd give my dad a break for once."
Cameron,"Oh, please. You know Jay doesn't like my dad. He thinks he's some bumpkin from the sticks. Well, I will have you know that Merle Stonewall Tucker is one of the most respected farmers in all of Hell's Hollow, Missouri."
Mitchell,"Okay, you're not hearing yourself. My dad likes him just fine. Come on."
Jay,Hello?
Mitchell,"Hey, dad. It's me."
Jay,Mitch. I'm sick. I gotta cancel tonight.
Mitchell,"Yeah. Yeah, 6:00. We're really looking forward to it."
Jay,What are you doing? I just said I can't come.
Mitchell,I don't know. Let me ask. My dad wants to know red or white?
Cameron,"Um, uh, red."
Mitchell,"Red. And I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah, Cam says red. Okay. Yeah, he's... he's so happy... Knock it off, old man. You are not sick. Why do you always do this?"
Jay,"Okay, look, between you and me, Mervis kind of bugs me."
Mitchell,"Okay, first of all, it's Merle. Mervis isn't a name. Mervis is a sound. And second of all, he's... he's my partner's father. Okay? You're coming."
Cameron,"Okay, dad, why don't you settle in? We don't have plans until dinner tonight with Jay and Gloria."
Cameron,What? That's... you like everybody.
Cameron,"Okay. Well, you know what? I'm gonna chalk this up to jet lag for you because it's not like you at all. Okay, you have to make an effort. It's my partner's father. Now give me the growl that means ""okay."" Good."
Phil,Did you know Walt had a daughter he was completely estranged from? His lawyer said she wouldn't even honor his last request to toss his dog tags in the ocean. Can you imagine?
Claire,"Phil, do we really have to go through this again? I told you, I would do everything possible to make sure that your skeleton ends up in a science class at a women's college."
Phil,"No, it's just sad. That's half of what would keep me going in my old age... remembering all the good times with the kids. Teaching Luke to ride his bike, Haley at the father-daughter dance... Taking Alex for her first pony ride."
Claire,You never took Alex on a pony ride.
Phil,"Oh, right. That was just me."
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,"But Alex and I went, um, oh, no. That was Haley."
Claire,"Phil, look. It's Luke. He's going into Walt's house."
Phil,"Oh, he's saying good-bye. He just needed a little time."
Claire,"It's so sweet and so sad. He's so much more sensitive than I ever thought. They had a special bond. I wouldn't be surprised if one day he wrote a book like ""Tuesdays with Morrie."""
Phil,I never read it. Did that guy steal Morrie's TV?
Phil,Now setting a course for adventure! Beep. Boop. Beep. Bop. Boop. Boop. Boop.
Phil,"I've had great experiences with all my kids, but I... I might have fallen behind a bit with Alex. My fault completely."
Alex,Adventure? We are throwing dog tag into an already polluted ocean where they will probably choke an otter.
Phil,80% my fault.
Phil,"Honey, we're bringing closure to a man's life. We'll hike up to the scenic overlook, where apparently, Walt proposed to his wife, wait for the light to be just right, say a few words. Share some memories."
Alex,That's kind of poetic. Kind of navajo.
Phil,"Now you're getting it. We'll be sending him off with a level of dignity, that if we're lucky, someday we'll experience, too. It's called..."
Claire,Hey. What do you got there? Walt's old TV?
Luke,He said I could take one thing after he died. I wish he would've said two things. I would've taken that phone with the big buttons.
Claire,"I bet you guys had some really good times watching this thing, right?"
Luke,No. I just wanted a TV in my room.
Claire,"You know, Luke, there might be a nicer way to honor Walt's memory."
Luke,What do you mean?
Claire,"Well, I mean, you guys liked to garden. We could, uh, we could take one of his flowers and plant it in our yard, and then every spring, when..."
Luke,There we go.
Claire,"Sweetie, how are you feeling? Sad? Angry? Confused? Frustrated? You know you can talk to me."
Luke,"I know, but I can't see through you. Could you scootch?"
Claire,"No. No. You know, this is not okay. It's going back."
Luke,What? He said I could pick one thing.
Claire,"This isn't picking. It's looting, and it's going back."
Luke,"You are so mean. When Walt used to look through those binoculars and say, ""your dad's one lucky man,"" he was wrong."
Manny,"Hi, Haley."
Haley,"Hi. Stef, Sam, this is Manny."
Haley,Kitchen's over there and pool's in the back.
Manny,So where are your parents?
Haley,They're not coming.
Manny,I was told there'd be a chaperone.
Haley,There is. It's you. My parents are totally fine with it.
Manny,"Well, exits, fire extinguisher, burn kit. Okay, let's have some fun."
Manny,"I believe I was clear the bedrooms were off-limits. Young lady, I don't think you're ready up here for what you're planning to do up there. Ugh. Not on my watch."
Cameron,"Oh, well, I'm very lucky, just like you and mama. Never had a bad patch. Except the winter of '85. Remember that?"
Cameron,"Oh, here. Let me help you."
Jay,I'll tell you why I don't like that guy... and I could never say this to Mitch... he treats my son like the wife in the relationship. Always has.
Cameron,"Oh! Oh, you didn't need to, dad. Love it!"
Mitchell,"Oh, Merle, thank you so much. Look at this. Oh. So elegant, huh? Oh, this is so sweet. I think I might cry."
Jay,Don't.
Alex,"Dad, I really gotta get home."
Phil,"I know. I know. You gotta do homework. But you can't expect me to see a sign that says, ""world's greatest milk shake... 50 miles,"" and not drive to it."
Phil,"I just wanted a special day with my daughter, you know, like ""the time we gave an old man a dramatic sendoff at the beach,"" or... or ""the time we drove 100 miles"" for the world's greatest milk shake."""
Phil,"""The time we delivered a baby."" We were the only ones there, and she was so close, the sound of a pin dropping could induce labor."
Phil,Okay! What looks good? What looks good? What looks good?
Gloria,"Not Manny. He's always been a little bit too serious. I would make the buildings, and he would inspect them. And if they weren't up to code, ay, ay, ay, the paperwork."
Jay,"I remember Mitchell, one time, karate-chopped a plate glass window. Got 17 stitches."
Gloria,"Ah, yes. I love that story. Which one of the Charlie's Angels he was being again?"
Jay,That's not important.
Jay,I'm sure he wasn't giggling.
Jay,"No, see, Mitchell has a booming laugh. It's Cameron, actually... has the high laugh. You know..."
Jay,"No, it's..."
Cameron,Listen to them.
Mitchell,"Listen to them. Best of friends. Cameron ; Oh, man. I'm sorry I doubted Jay. He's been lovely."
Mitchell,"Oh, well, confession time... he kinda didn't want to come."
Cameron,"Well, you're gonna laugh because my dad was kinda hoping he wouldn't."
Mitchell,Wha? Oh. They just needed to get to know one another better. I am so glad that we did this.
Cameron,"Yeah, me, too."
Mitchell,"Oh, that's so funny. Wh-what did your dad not like about my dad?"
Cameron,"Oh, well, you know Jay. He's a Teddy bear, but sometimes he can kinda come off as a tough guy."
Mitchell,"Yeah, that's true."
Cameron,"As an actual tough guy, you can kinda see how that would rub my dad the wrong way."
Mitchell,"Oh, it's... I-I could see that, but, you know, my dad's actually pretty tough himself, so..."
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, city tough, you know, not farm tough."
Mitchell,"Uh-huh. You mean cities, where there are gangs, as to opposed to farms, where there are ducks?"
Mitchell,"Yeah. Why don't you hop on in there, dad?"
Cameron,My dad's got it.
Jay,"All right, let's see here. Hang on, Merle. Wait. Here. Huh? Hold."
Jay,Oh. It's coming.
Cameron,"Oh, there you go. There you go."
Cameron,"Sure thing, dad. You earned it."
Mitchell,"Yeah. Good helping there, Merle."
Claire,"Okay. Wow. It's hot in here. It's, like, 80 degrees."
Luke,He did that so the Meals on Wheels lady had to take off her sweater.
Claire,"How do we turn on the lights in here? Of course. So, Luke, now that we're here, you wanna take a minute and say what Walt meant to you?"
Luke,Nope.
Claire,"Luke, you are going through something huge in your life, and I'm concerned that you're not processing it in a normal, healthy way."
Luke,I'm sad. I'm so very sad.
Claire,"No, I don't just wanna hear what you think I wanna hear. I want you to really tell me..."
Claire,Oh.
Claire,I have some sad news about Walt. He's dead.
Claire,He died last night.
Claire,No. He had a heart attack.
Claire,I'm not smiling.
Luke,"You are, mom. It's kinda creepy."
Claire,"Well, I'm sure you can imagine."
Claire,Mm! Okay. He is... dead.
Claire,"Yeah, he's dead."
Claire,Nothing.
Claire,I don't. I don't think it's funny. I'm not smiling.
Claire,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just found out my face does this.
Luke,"Wow, mom. That was so wrong."
Claire,"Well, it's... it's called a coping mechanism, Luke. Some people repress their feelings and some people just smile. But d... it doesn't matter. Just put the TV in the den. Let's get out of here."
Luke,"It doesn't go in the den. It goes right here. I can see it from my room. Sometimes I'd wake up in the middle of the night and look down here. If the TV was on, I knew he was up, and I don't know, I guess I'm gonna miss that."
Claire,Yeah. That's... Yeah.
Phil,"Yeah, it still feels just, you know, a little wobbly."
Alex,"Oh! Oh, my God. Okay, no, no, no. That's... that's fine. Thank you. Thank you."
Phil,"Okay, it's ""go"" time."
Alex,"Please, no. He's already made me eat the world's greatest everything on the menu. Dad, why are you acting like this? Is this about Walt dying?"
Phil,No. It's about what he didn't do when he was alive... have a special bond with his daughter. I don't want to be that kind of dad. I want to be Eugene Cernan.
Alex,Who's Eugene cernan?
Phil,"""Apollo 17"" astronaut, last man on the moon, coolest dad of all time. When he was leaving the moon, he reached down and wrote his daughter's initials into the lunar surface. Since there's no atmosphere..."
Alex,"There'll be there forever. Wow. So every time she looks in the sky, she knows there's a message just for her."
Phil,Exactly. That's why dads everywhere hate Eugene Cernan.
Alex,"Oh, no."
Phil,"Okay, ""hate's"" a strong word. It's just... I'm trying to make... Oh. Oh, boy. Honey. Okay. I really wanna help, but you know when someone yawns, it makes you yawn?"
Alex,"You're not gonna yawn, are you?"
Phil,I already yawned a little in my mouth.
Alex,"Oh, God."
Jay,You really wanna know?
Jay,Sometimes I think you treat my son like the woman in their relationship.
Jay,Like those watches. Cam's was all big and manly. The other one looked like something Grace Kelly would wear.
Jay,"It's skinny, not slender. And you're honestly telling me you don't cast Mitch in the more ladylike role?"
Jay,I don't think about it that way. It's not like it was in our day. Husband went out to work. Wife stayed home with the kids.
Jay,Fine. They're both equal. Neither one is the wife.
Jay,"I get it. Every time I start to feel comfortable with this thing, some new part comes up I gotta wrap my head around."
Jay,"Yep. We got two sons, and they're gay for each other."
Phil,I'll take it slow on the way home. Don't worry. Canceling course for adventure. Beep. Boop. Beep. Bop. Mm.
Alex,You know what I'll never forget? The time my dad spent the entire day trying to create a special memory for me. Or when a pregnant lady slipped in my vomit.
Phil,Hang on. I wanna do one thing before we go.
Claire,"Hey, you on your way home?"
Phil,Just about. How's everything there?
Claire,"Actually, it's pretty great. I can't wait to see you."
Phil,"Me, too. Okay. Let's hit it. I don't know. I feel like maybe we should get some food on the way home."
Alex,Don't.
Phil,Maybe a nice tuna melt.
Alex,Stop it.
Manny,"I did what I could, mom. It was a nightmare. I can't tell you how many times I turned off the bathroom light."
Gloria,Haley!
Haley,"Oh, crap. Listen, Gloria. Okay, everything I told you technically was not..."
Gloria,You lied to me so that you could have a party without supervision!
Haley,"Oh, I had plenty of supervision. He was running around all night with his coasters and vacuum and his ""make good choices"" speech."
Gloria,Good. Somebody needed to be responsible.
Manny,Thank you.
Gloria,Not you. You take rules too seriously.
Manny,I'm in trouble?
Gloria,You are 13. You're not supposed to be vacuuming the party. You're supposed to be enjoying the party.
Haley,Exactly.
Gloria,A party that you shouldn't have been having!
Manny,It seems like you're sending mixed signals here.
Haley,"Yeah, maybe I should get my friends and just leave."
Gloria,"No, you're in trouble, little young lady. You're having this party!"
Manny,"What? They've been using glassware by the pool, putting feet on the furniture, and begging girls to kiss each other."
Gloria,"Yes! All the things that you should have been doing! Yeah, all those things are fine. Go. Have fun and go crazy."
Haley,But he's gonna ruin my party.
Gloria,Two birds with one bullet.
Phil,"How are you doing? Phil Danoughy. What do I have to get you to ask, ""What do I have to do to get you into this car today?"""
Phil,Sounds good. Right where I want him.
Phil,"Well, I guess this is what I'll be driving for the next 39 months."
Phil,"No, it's great. I've just leased the same thing forever. Part of me wants to shake things up. I don't know. Get something like... like that."
Phil,"Colonel Klink, that is nice."
Mitchell,We took Lily on her first train ride. Just a quick trip to Chinatown.
Cameron,"I was worried she would think we were taking her back to Vietnam, but she seemed okay."
Mitchell,"Yeah, yeah. Possibly because she was an infant when she left Vietnam. Also, Vietnam is not China."
Cameron,"Well, I had a lollipop with me just in case."
Cameron,I love that we're doing this. It's important for her to explore the city she lives in.
Mitchell,So much diversity. Keep your wallet in your front pocket.
Cameron,"Oh, sweetie, it is. Here, have a seat. Right here. There you go. Hey, hold Bunny."
Mitchell,"No! No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Cameron,"How did you miss that, Mitchell?"
Mitchell,Mr. Conductor! I-I... What? I was purell-ing! And it's me! Why would you toss it?
Cameron,Because my hands were full?
Mitchell,I want Bunny!
Cameron,"I know. W... okay, I have an idea. Let's catch the next train and ride it till it catches up."
Mitchell,They don't catch up. That's called a collision.
Cameron,"Okay, well, do you have a better idea? You're the one that lost it."
Mitchell,"No, you tossed it. He who tossed it lost it."
Cameron,Don't try to clever your way out of this.
Phil,"Oh, I wanted a car like this since I was a kid."
Phil,"I used to imagine the wind blowing through my perm, blasting some Hall & Oates, maybe horsing around with my Mr. Microphone..."
Phil,"No, it's not practical."
Phil,I thought you operated on knees and elbows.
Phil,What would Claire say?
Phil,Yeah.
Phil,I have a spine.
Phil,I have a spine.
Phil,"You know what? I'd rather take her for a spin. Let's get her top down and see what she can do. I'm... no, I meant the convertible."
Manny,"Well, I just talked to the concierge, and room service will save me a bread pudding."
Jay,Load off my mind.
Manny,"You mock me, but ""Travel and Leisure"" says it's not to be missed."
Jay,"This weekend, we're going up to Pebble Beach. I'm gonna meet a bunch of guys I played high school football with. Man, those were the good old days."
Gloria,"Yeah, unless you were a woman, black, Hispanic, or gay."
Jay,"True, but if you were a straight white guy who played football, you really couldn't have a bad day."
Jay,Gloria? Hmm? Which watch should I pack? This one's showier. This one's more expensive.
Gloria,Why do you care so much about a watch?
Jay,How do I say this without sounding like an ass? I'm kind of a legend to these guys.
Gloria,Not like that.
Phil,Hey! Who's your daddy?
Luke,Whoa! Whose car is this?
Phil,Mine!
Luke,Seriously? Mom's gonna let you have this?
Phil,"Luke, Luke, Luke... Where is she?"
Alex,"Dad, I don't like this."
Phil,Why not?
Alex,"My friend Molly's dad bought a sports car, and now he lives in a studio apartment and dates a girl who works at forever 21, which she won't be for two years."
Phil,"Honey, I'm not leaving your mom."
Luke,Might not be your call.
Haley,"Oh, my God, it's so pretty! I love it! And I love you, and I promise I'll take super good care of it!"
Alex,Can I tell her? Please. I ask for so little.
Phil,"Alex, be nice to your sister."
Alex,"It's dad's car, not yours."
Haley,What? But you're too old for this! It's just like last year when you wouldn't take off those skinny jeans.
Alex,Wouldn't or couldn't?
Phil,Hey. I looked hot.
Claire,Oh.
Claire,Andre.
Phil,Honey.
Claire,Is this the new car?
Phil,"I know it looks impractical, but Andre's seen a lot of people die."
Claire,"I'm not upset. I'm not upset. It's a beautiful car. Just surprised you didn't get the sedan, that's all. Beautiful."
Claire,Mm. Beautiful.
Phil,What just happened?
Phil,Do you wanna come in for a minute?
Phil,"Well, do you... Uh, do you need a ride or anything?"
Phil,Why... why are you running?
Mitchell,"Lily was up all night because she didn't have Bnny, which means that we were up all night because she didn't have Bunny. God, she must have cried for... How long was it, Cam? Cam. Cam. Hmm?"
Cameron,"Oh, sorry. Uh, last night was rough because Lily..."
Mitchell,Covered it. Didn't have Bunny.
Gloria,"Jay, tell me, why are we on the runway?"
Jay,Surprise! We're taking a private plane.
Manny,Wow! I've never been on a private plane!
Gloria,And you never will. I am not getting on that little thing! What if the rubber band snaps and we fall out of the sky?
Jay,It's perfectly safe. It's a legitimate airline!
Jay,No problem. I'm about 190.
Gloria,"Oh, yeah. In that case, I'm 275."
Jay,"Gloria, I would never put you and Manny in danger. Now come on! Trust me on this! Beautiful."
Jay,"It's American music the whole way, and I don't wanna hear a word."
Claire,"How you doing there, sport?"
Phil,"Great. Yeah. Awesome. You know what's awesome? Is this car has the engine in the trunk, so that means I get to... put these signs in the seat, which is cool."
Claire,Very cool.
Phil,Huh.
Claire,What?
Phil,"Oh, nothing. My, uh, client just wants me to pick her up on the way to the open house, which is great. I'll, uh, drop the sign off and just swing across town to... Oh. She's bringing her mom and a designer."
Claire,"Well, maybe they'll fit in the trunk."
Phil,Here it comes!
Claire,What? I was making a joke.
Phil,"What's your game, woman?"
Claire,I have no game. You're an adult. You can make your own choices.
Phil,Since when?
Claire,Do you wanna borrow the minivan?
Phil,"Yes, please."
Claire,"Okay, fine. Then you're gonna have to pick up the kids from school."
Phil,"Okay, I can't take it. If you got something to say, just say it."
Claire,I have nothing to say.
Phil,That just says it all.
Claire,Well... Okay.
Manny,"All... all right. Thank you, Serena. See you tonight. Good news... they rescheduled my massage for the morning. Bad news... it's a dude."
Jay,Don't blame me. It's your mom's fault.
Gloria,"Do you know how many people have died in these planes? John Denver, Patsy Cline, Ritchie Valens."
Jay,"I've heard you sing. I think you're safe. All right, look, the welcome dinner starts in four hours. It's a 5-hour drive. No bathroom breaks. Yeah, I think you're gonna want to hold on to that cup. Damn it!"
Gloria,What was that?
Jay,Giant pothole. The dash is lighting up like a Christmas tree. Tire's blown! This never would have happened if we were in the air!
Gloria,"If this had happened in the air, we wouldn't be in the air. We would be in rock 'n' roll heaven!"
Cameron,"Okay, what do you think? I'm gonna put these in the subway."
Mitchell,"Okay, it looks like, uh, Lily's missing and we're offering $25 to get her back."
Cameron,"Oh, don't be ridiculous. No one in their right mind... Okay. That's all I see now. How about this one?"
Mitchell,"Okay. Um... ""Missing... stuffed bunny. Brown and white fur. Sympathetic eyes."" What are sympathetic eyes?"
Cameron,Not those.
Mitchell,I just... I don't really love the idea of our phone number being up in the subway.
Cameron,"Okay, let's play a different game. How about I be the problem, and you be the solution?"
Mitchell,I'm sorry. I shouldn't be so critical. I know you're just trying to... Got it! Just came up with a better idea. Took me less than five seconds.
Claire,"I can't hear you. What? Window. I don't know... Gah! What did I do? Oh. Oh, my. Yes. Hi."
Claire,Thank you.
Claire,"Oh, no. I'm gonna do some errands, actually. Yeah, 'cause other people might go and buy a crazy car with an engine in the... in the trunk, but not me. No. I'm responsible. Mm-hmm. We have three kids. You can't pick up three kids in this car. You can't. You... it... it... I'll get you... catch ya. I'm going!"
Claire,"Maybe I was a teeny bit mad. So I blew off my errands and headed up the coast. It was my turn to be irresponsible. And luckily, I had sunscreen in my purse."
Jay,Fantastic. I don't suppose there's any place you can rent cars anywhere around here?
Jay,Unbelievable. We're gonna miss the whole weekend.
Gloria,"I am sorry, Jay. I know how much you mean to those guys, and I know how much they want to see you. I'm so sorry."
Gloria,"Ay, yes, please! Thank you! Anything!"
Gloria,No. I did not get in the little plane at the little airport! I'm not gonna get in this... takka-takka-takka-takka flown by that guy that couldn't fix our car!
Jay,"Gloria, it's either this, or we're in the motel."
Manny,"I don't like the sound of that. A lot of amenities disappear when an ""H"" becomes an ""M."""
Jay,"You know, when I met you, you were eating cereal out of a bucket."
Mitchell,"Hey, Lily, guess what?"
Mitchell,"Uh, we just heard from Bunny."
Cameron,This is a terrible idea.
Mitchell,"No, it's fantastic. Bunny said he's on an amazing adventure having the time of his life, and that you should pick one of his best friends to sleep with while he's gone."
Cameron,This is going great.
Mitchell,"He does now, because... because he took talking lessons. So what do you think, huh? Turtle or giraffe or, uh, little reindeer?"
Mitchell,"Uh, St. Louis."
Mitchell,He's visiting his girlfriend.
Mitchell,"Okay. No, no, Lily. Lily, uh, what about Miss, uh, Teddy Bear? Huh? No? Uh, Dr. Tiger? No? Mr. Fish?"
Cameron,Really? You don't know Nemo? It's on an endless loop in the den.
Mitchell,I have a job.
Luke,"And then Bodie kicked it to me, and I dribbled it past Michael and got it to Tyler..."
Phil,"I was bummed not to be in my new cool car, so I wasn't joking around with the kids like I usually do."
Luke,And I would've scored if that kid didn't trip me. I can't believe the ref didn't see it.
Luke,"Yeah, I know. It's like she's in love with soccer."
Haley,Ugh. Stop texting me!
Alex,What?
Haley,Corey. He is so clingy.
Phil,"But, you know, there's something about driving your kids around. You're in the front, they're in the back. They forget you're there, and you learn so much. You're like Sigourney Weaver in ""Gorillas in the Mist."" Except gorillas make less noise chewing."
Claire,"Once I hit the coast highway, I didn't stop. I turned off my cell phone. I ate fish tacos for lunch. It was insane! I haven't felt that free in years. All my stress completely disappeared... And so did my keys."
Mitchell,"I'm sorry, but... these signs are ridiculous."
Cameron,"Oh, you're right. I should have used Helvetica. It much better represents the urgency of our situation."
Mitchell,"No, the lengths that we're going to for a stuffed animal. You know, Cam, maybe it's time Lily learned about loss."
Cameron,"No, she's 3, and I know. Do you know how many times I had to say good-bye to a furry friend on the farm?"
Mitchell,And didn't it make you stronger?
Cameron,"Yeah, because I was a growing boy and they were chock-full of protein. But it was still heartbreaking."
Mitchell,"It builds character. You know, once, when I was a kid, my dad left my Luke Skywalker doll on an airplane, and I was so angry..."
Cameron,"Wait, which... which Luke? Shorty robe or dress blacks?"
Mitchell,Shorty robe.
Cameron,"Oh, my."
Mitchell,"And you know what he did to get it back? Not a damn thing. Nope. He didn't lift one pudgy finger to make a single phone call, and I got over it."
Cameron,"Yeah, well, I want you and Lily to have the same healthy relationship you and your father have. For sure."
Mitchell,"All right, give me these flyers. I'm gonna take everything to this side of the homeless guy."
Cameron,Mitchell!
Mitchell,"Sorry, what are we supposed to say now? Home-challenged? Or..."
Cameron,"No, look!"
Mitchell,"Oh, my God! It's Bunny! Oh, Lily's gonna be so happy. Oh, that's so great. Go ahead and get it."
Cameron,"What, me?"
Mitchell,Yeah.
Cameron,Why should I go and get it?
Mitchell,"Well, I-I'm not gonna do it."
Cameron,Why?
Mitchell,I spotted it. You're closer.
Cameron,It's your journey. Luke Skywalker? Pattern-breaking? Your father? Get in there.
Mitchell,"Fine. Sir... hi, sir. Hello, you... you... Hello. Yeah. Hello. He-hello? Sir... I-I can't..."
Cameron,"Oh, for God sakes!"
Cameron,Let her hate us. You turned out great.
Mitchell,"I did, didn't I?"
Cameron,You're a big lawyer.
Manny,This is not the massage I had in mind.
Jay,"All right. Okay. In about an hour, a train goes through town that will get us close to pebble beach. Now it's not technically a-a passenger train, so it won't be stopping."
Gloria,What?
Jay,"So we gotta get running real good. No high-heeled shoes. And it wouldn't be wrong if we took that blanket with us, either, huh? So what do you say? Anybody up for a hobo adventure?"
Manny,"If we're voting, I'm a ""no."""
Gloria,"Manny, we're gonna be right back. We're gonna get some ice from the machine in the parking lot."
Manny,Classy.
Gloria,"Jay, this is getting crazy. Is it worth it?"
Jay,I wanna see the old gang.
Gloria,"Do you wanna see them or you want to show off to them? The private plane, the fancy watch. You still want to feel that you're the big kahuna on the campus."
Jay,That's not it. That's not even a thing.
Gloria,"You know what? I'm taking Manny home. If you want to go in the takka-takka-takka-takka, okay. Go to Pebble Beach by yourself."
Jay,"No, what? That's not the plan."
Gloria,"If you wanna go there so bad, that's the only way you're gonna get there."
Jay,I'm not trying to get me there. I'm trying to get you there!
Gloria,What?
Jay,"Look... I may have exaggerated the size... kahuna I was. I may not... technically have been a kahuna. I was shy, and I spent most of my time... on the bench."
Gloria,But you always made it sound like you...
Jay,"Oh, I know what I made it sound like. People didn't expect much from me, and, um... They certainly didn't expect me to end up with... somebody like you."
Gloria,So this is all about you parading me around like a trophy?
Jay,Yes.
Gloria,Why didn't you say so? I can be a trophy! Come on. We need to get this up to Pebble Beach. Manny! We're leaving! Get ready!
Manny,"Oh, good. If we get out of here in the next ten minutes, we don't have to pay for the second hour."
Phil,"How you doing there, sport?"
Claire,I'm sorry.
Phil,That's okay.
Claire,Thanks.
Phil,So... Whatcha doing all the way up here? Did someone snap?
Claire,A little. Yeah. I was mad at you for buying that stupid sports car.
Phil,I knew it!
Claire,"And I was wrong. It's a great car. God, I had the best day. Phil, I did cartwheels."
Phil,Without me?
Claire,Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Phil,"Hey, did you know there's a girl with a crush on Luke?"
Claire,Olivia. Yeah.
Phil,Alex is teaching herself Chinese so she'll be useful when they finish buying us.
Claire,She's so weird.
Phil,I really want to be able to drive the kids around. I need a bigger car for work. I made a mistake.
Claire,"No, you didn't. You bought it for a reason. When did we stop coming to the beach?"
Phil,I think it was when Alex started printing out water quality reports.
Claire,She'll be China's problem soon.
Phil,You know... We don't need a sports car to get out here.
Claire,Mm.
Phil,"We should just make a pact. Once a month, we get out to the beach."
Claire,And we tell everyone we're running errands.
Phil,So you didn't get to the dry cleaner?
Manny,"They say the important thing in life isn't the destination. It's the journey, the challenges you face along the way... The unexpected twists and turns... The disappointments you overcome."
Cameron,Look what I found on the Internet.
Mitchell,"Oh, my God! It's Luke Skywalker in his shorty robe! I love it, Cam..."
Manny,"But they're wrong. It's all about the destination, especially when the destination is your amazing oceanfront hotel. Thank you again, Serena. Warmest regards, Manny Delgado."
Jay,What's he doing?
Gloria,He's sending flowers to the concierge.
Jay,"Oh, jeez."
Manny,Hey... Credit card.
Phil,This is not about Claire. I really want to sell you the car.
Phil,"No, I... Turns out I'm just not a convertible guy."
Phil,Right?
Phil,What?
Phil,I don't smell anything.
Phil,Huh?
Phil,"Your wife won't let you have a convertible, will she?"
Phil,Why are you running again?
Luke,"Please, please, please, please."
Alex,"Okay, what is this?"
Luke,We're making sure I'm tall enough to ride all the rides at Disneyland without having to spike up my hair.
Phil,Buddy... we are good to go.
Luke,Sweet!
Phil,"I have been waiting for this day ever since the doctor pointed to the ultrasound of your mom's womb and said, ""either that's a fifth limb, or you got a boy."""
Haley,"Okay, no. Gross."
Claire,"All right... I want everybody to eat a lot at home because ""the happiest place on earth"" is also home to the most expensive churro on Earth."
Phil,Come on. This is gonna be awesome. Who doesn't love a day at Disneyland?
Manny,Can't you and mom go without me?
Jay,You're the kid. I think we need you to get in.
Manny,"Well, it couldn't come on a worst day. The technology sector is tanking."
Manny,"We're doing a stock market project in school, and today's the last day. We all get a thousand fake dollars to invest, and as the market closed yesterday, I'm in the lead. I may not be the tallest or the most athletic, but someday I will be the richest, which is good because the ladies love that, and I've grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle."
Jay,Do you really wants girls who only want you for your money?
Manny,I'd like to have that option.
Gloria,"Manny, put the stock away and put your ears on."
Manny,"Mom, I don't think you have to wear one of these."
Gloria,Be a kid! Put them on!
Jay,Really? Those shoes?
Gloria,What?
Jay,Do you know how much walking you have to do at Disneyland? Why do you think they have so many fat people on scooters?
Gloria,I like wearing the high heels. I'm fine.
Jay,"It's just like that jacket you refuse to bring when I say, ""take a jacket."" ""Don't tell me what to do! I'm fine!"" Huh? And you're not fine. You're cold and shivering, and I look like the jerk who won't give his wife a jacket, so I do, and then I'm cold and shivering, and I brought a jacket."
Gloria,Are you done with your boring jacket story? Because we're going to hit traffic.
Jay,Tell you one thing. I'm not gonna give you my shoes.
Claire,Ah! That must be Ethan.
Haley,Who's Ethan?
Claire,"Didn't I tell you? My friend Bethenny's nephew is coming with us today. He moved to town to go to college. He's very nice, very smart, big hockey player."
Haley,I know what you're doing.
Alex,Really? She was so subtle.
Claire,"Haley has a thing for bad boys, which was so me."
Phil,Clearly.
Claire,"So if she's going to be leaving the nest soon, we'd prefer it was not on the back of a motorcycle."
Phil,"My college roommate had a motorcycle. Man, I had some good times on the back of that thing."
Haley,I can't believe you did this. I'm not gonna babysit Bethenny's nephew. Alex can have him.
Alex,"Okay, I don't need your rejects."
Claire,"Hi. Hi, Ethan! I'm so glad you could make it."
Claire,Sure.
Alex,Hi. I'm Al...
Haley,"My 14-year-old sister. Ethan, was it?"
Haley,And that's my grandpa and his wife Gloria and her son Manny.
Haley,Big family.
Claire,She likes him!
Cameron,"Yeah, who wouldn't? Where'd you find him, a Tommy Hilfiger catalog?"
Claire,He got a 2200 on his S.A.T.s. And those eyes...
Mitchell,"Okay, did you get him for Haley or for you?"
Claire,Mitchell.
Mitchell,"You know, I haven't been here since dad brought us when we were kids."
Claire,"Ohh, yeah. Remember? You cried in the Abraham Lincoln thing."
Jay,"Hey, he's a great president, and it was the first robot I ever saw."
Jay,"When Claire and Mitchell were young, their mom and I were gonna take them to Disneyland. But that morning, Dede and I got in this huge fight over something or other... surprise, surprise... and I ended up taking them on my own. Claire's biggest fear was running into the evil queen. My biggest fear was that I married her."
Phil,"Okay, people over 46 inches, first stop... Indiana Jones!"
Luke,"Have fun on the teacups, Lily."
Jay,"Okay, let's do this."
Cameron,"Oh, okay, wait just a second here, everybody. All right."
Gloria,Is that a leash?
Cameron,"No, it's a child safety tether. This way, sweetie."
Mitchell,It... it's a leash. Don't... don't judge us.
Cameron,Go on.
Cameron,We have a runner.
Mitchell,"Lily is going through a phase-- at least... Oh, we hope it's a phase."
Cameron,She bolts every chance she gets.
Cameron,Lily! Lily! Lily!
Cameron,So we had no choice to put her on a child safety tether.
Mitchell,It's a leash. And we did have a choice.
Cameron,"Lily, sweetie, don't pull."
Jay,"Lily, heel!"
Mitchell,Dad.
Jay,"If I'd had known you guys were gonna do this, I'd have brought Stella."
Mitchell,It was Cam's idea.
Cameron,"So much for the united front. I'll have you know, despite all your jokes, Lily enjoys it. Okay, sweetie, you're not helping. You're not helping."
Alex,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You guys, is that Dylan?"
Haley,What?
Claire,"Oh, jeez."
Haley,Dylan?!
Haley,"Uh, what are you... I didn't even know you were in town."
Haley,I thought you were still in Wyoming.
Mitchell,Hi.
Alex,"Yep. You date her, that's the club you're joining."
Haley,Of course he would still look amazing.
Claire,"Does he? I hadn't noticed. Did you know that Ethan plays the trumpet? No great surprise with those lips of his, huh?"
Mitchell,"Coo-coo-ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson."
Phil,"Okay, buddy, moment of truth."
Luke,Yes!
Phil,This is gonna be so awesome!
Luke,Yeah!
Phil,"In 45 minutes, this is gonna be so awesome!"
Luke,Yeah!
Manny,"Look, Reuben, I have some underperformers I have to unload, and I don't have access to a computer. Log in as moneydelgado..."
Gloria,Manny!
Manny,"By all means, Reuben, go get a popsicle while the Nikkei closes. I wanna be a pauper. Mom, my stocks just took a dive."
Gloria,Your phone is about to take a dive.
Jay,Come on! Where do we want to go next?
Alex,Oh! Ethan and I want to try the haunted mansion.
Claire,There is no you and Ethan.
Gloria,Let's go to the jungle cruise. It's right there.
Jay,Why? Tired of walking in those heels?
Gloria,No. You tired of being with a hot wife?
Cameron,"Well, well, well. What do you know? Another caring parent with a child safety tether. See? We're not the only people who use them. Hi! Aren't they adorable?"
Cameron,"Oh, well, yes. She just wanted to say hi."
Cameron,Oh! No problem. She's friendly.
Mitchell,"Oh, his... his name's Rex, huh?"
Cameron,"Oh, okay. Lily, no, sweetie. Lily, um..."
Cameron,"Oh, yeah, no... oh, no problem. Lily, stop moving, sweetie. Stop moving."
Mitchell,"Okay, you got this."
Cameron,Okay. Okay. Good girl! Good girl! Sorry.
Jay,"You know what the fight with Dede was about? I taped a football game over an episode of ""Dallas."" Who bails on a family trip to Disneyland over something like that? Ironically, Dallas was playing in the game. And I remember pointing that out to her, and then I remember a video cassette flying at my head."
Alex,I do. Even geekier... I'm good.
Alex,I will answer you this.
Alex,"I know, right? Like, go where the cello is."
Claire,"Oh, look at this. I think I've inadvertently set up my 14-year-old with a college boy."
Jay,The boy was your doing?
Claire,"Yes. Yes, and he was perfect, and Haley was into him until, of course, we ran into Dylan. I mean, come on, dad. What are the odds of that happening?"
Jay,It's a small world.
Claire,"Yes, it is."
Jay,You see what I did there?
Claire,I did.
Jay,'Cause it's a ride.
Claire,"I got it. Got it, dad. I got it. It's so frustrating because... I know I can't run Haley's like for her, but if she would let me, I would be so good at it."
Jay,"Right, 'cause parents always know what's best for their kids. You remember that nice girl at the office I tried to fix Mitch up with?"
Claire,"No offense, dad, but I think I probably have a better sense of what my kids need than you did."
Jay,I think it's cute you think that.
Luke,Mom! It was so awesome! The jeep was jerking around... And... and there was a lot of sharp turns and big drops.
Claire,Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Phil,It just kept going.
Claire,Wow. You okay?
Phil,Great. Why wouldn't I be?
Claire,Because you're kinda leaning on me.
Phil,"Well, isn't that what a marriage is?"
Claire,"Ohh. Oh, Alex, stop touching him."
Jay,Oh. You look like hell.
Phil,I'm feeling a little dizzy. I think that ride did something to me.
Jay,The fluid in your inner ear is thickening. That's what happens when you get old.
Phil,It is?
Jay,"Yeah, you can't take the motion. I gotta pop a dramamine to get in my swivel chair."
Phil,That is not it. I'm king of the roller coasters. I think I just put too big of a whipped cream smile on my pancake this morning.
Luke,You guys wanna go on Matterhorn?
Jay,"Luke, I think me and your dad are gonna sit this one out, maybe get one them big pickles."
Phil,"No! You're gonna have to eat that pickle on your own, Jay. I still got a few good years left. Luke, wait up! I'll race you there! I'm good. I'm good."
Mitchell,"Okay, everybody's looking at us. I haven't been judged by this many people since I forgot my canvas bags at whole foods."
Cameron,"Yeah, well, maybe they're staring because we have what they want."
Mitchell,"Whoa! Oh, a pet daughter. 'Cause that..."
Cameron,"You know, I don't care what people think. If I thought it would keep my daughter safe, I would have a kangaroo pouch sewn into my midriff."
Mitchell,"That's gonna work out really well for you as a single parent. Okay, we just got a glare from Mr. Socks-with-sandals. All right, that's it. Lily, I'm gonna take off this leash."
Cameron,I think it's a mistake.
Mitchell,"But I don't want you to run away, 'cause that would be very, very unsafe, and if we lost you, you'd be very scared, and we'd be very sad. Okay?"
Mitchell,"All right. See, Cam? You treat her like a human being and she acts like one."
Cameron,"Oh, great. Now she's chasing squirrels. Lily!"
Mitchell,"Honey, come on!"
Cameron,Lily! Lily!
Jay,Hey! How was Splash Mountain?
Gloria,It was great! Maybe we go again.
Manny,"No, thanks. There was no reception in there. You know how many bars I had? Zip-a-Dee-doo-dah. Reuben, talk to me!"
Jay,Must be nice to get out of those shoes for a minute.
Gloria,I don't know what you talking about.
Jay,"Nothing. I'm just making conversation. Hey. Check it out. I bought one of those souvenir photos with you and Manny on the ride. Boy, it looks like you're having a good time. Wait a minute. What's that in your hand? Are those shoes?"
Gloria,"I'm not even sure that that is us, Jay."
Jay,Why are you walking around in pain? Just admit the shoes were a bad idea.
Gloria,I am not in pain. I just didn't want my favorite walking shoes to get wet there.
Jay,"Okay, my bad. Well, we've gotta meet everybody in Tomorrowland, so we'd better get movin' 'cause it's all the way on the other side of the park."
Gloria,I'm fine. You just try to keep up with us.
Jay,I can't take this.
Luke,"Dad, throw your hands up! It's fun!"
Phil,"Oh, yeah, it is fun!"
Manny,"Reuben, if you heard about that stock at a birthday party, it's already too late."
Jay,"Gloria! Gloria, sit down for a second."
Gloria,"I'm fine, Jay."
Jay,Please? Look... You may not be in pain... But I'm in pain just thinking you're in pain. So humor me for one minute.
Gloria,What are those?
Jay,There wasn't a big selection at the Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique.
Gloria,"Are you crazy? I cannot walk around in public with these... things. They're so yellow and so ugly. And... and they're so softy and so comfortable. Jay, what is this? Thank you for going shopping for me. Thank you for worrying about my feet. Thank you for giving me your jacket when I'm cold. You're such a good man, Jay. Thank you."
Jay,Wow. I didn't expect you to be so... So nice.
Gloria,Why are you so surprised?
Jay,Now please don't go all Latin on me when I say this. Is it possible you get angry from time to time because you're always wearing... uncomfortable shoes?
Gloria,Maybe. Can you get me a couple of more? Maybe they have purple?
Jay,"Whatever you want, honey."
Claire,"All I'm saying is, it seemed like you were pretty into Ethan until Dylan showed up."
Haley,"Don't get me wrong. Ethan's nice, but he's no Dylan."
Claire,Maybe that's a good thing?
Haley,Why? Because Dylan's a free spirit? He's too edgy for you? He plays by his own rules?
Claire,"Oh, my God."
Haley,What?
Claire,I beg of you to turn around and experience with me the greatest moment of my life. Your rebel boyfriend's a Dapper Dan.
Haley,Maybe that's not him.
Claire,It certainly seems like him.
Haley,"Oh, my God. He looked like those old pictures of dad from High School."
Alex,"Oh, there's a really great exhibit downtown. I'll take you."
Haley,"Oh, on what, your razor scooter? Mom wants you."
Alex,I-I-I...
Haley,Ethan! I've been looking all over for you!
Jay,"I remember I was on Pirates of the Caribbean, and this whole fight with Dede was really eating at me. And there was this angry animatronic wench with a rolling pin, chasing some poor pirate around. They were on a track, running in circles, so he could never get away from her. And I remember thinking, I can't save you, buddy, but I'm getting off this ride."
Luke,"And... and we were going around a corner, and I was screaming and I swallowed a bug. Oh, being tail is everything that I dreamed it would be. What should we do next?"
Phil,Sit down.
Luke,Where we gonna sit down?
Phil,"The ground. Here, this is good right here. Oh!"
Luke,"Are you okay, dad?"
Phil,"No, I'm not okay. I hate to tell you this, but these rides are killing me."
Luke,B-but you're the king of roller coasters.
Phil,"I know! Something happens when you get older. Guess you can't take it. One of my favorite things in the world is doing stupid fun stuff with you, like pogo stick basketball or trying to get a swing to go all the way around."
Luke,"Next time, we should sit on a fire extinguisher."
Phil,"Yes, or a bottle of coke and some mentos. Honestly, though, the way I'm feeling right now, I don't know if there's gonna be a next time."
Luke,"Dad, we can always find cool stuff to do. Even if you're old and in a wheelchair, I'll take you to the mall and push you as fast as you wanna go."
Phil,Really? You'd do that?
Luke,"Heck, yeah. And we'll pop some wheelies, too."
Phil,That sounds fun.
Luke,And I'll take you to the top of a huge hill and just let go.
Phil,"Okay, we'll nail down the specifics later, but that... that's really nice."
Luke,So do you still wanna talk or...
Phil,"No, go. Ride Space Mountain. Hey! Hey! At the end, when they take a picture, do something hilarious for both of us. You're gonna die. When you see it, not 'cause you're old."
Mitchell,"Lily! Lily, stop! Dad! Dad, grab her!"
Jay,"Hey, I gotcha, you little monkey!"
Mitchell,"Thank you. Hey, Cam, I got her. We're in Fantasyland. Where are you? Okay, it's Toontown, not Toonton. You've been watching too much PBS. Thank you. All right, honey, come here."
Mitchell,"Yeah? Well, I don't like running like a crazy person through Downton Disney... Downtown Disney. I don't know what to do."
Jay,"Well, the leash is not the answer. You want my help?"
Mitchell,"Yes, please!"
Jay,"'Cause I can fix this for you in about two minutes. Come on, baby girl. Come with me. We'll be right back."
Gloria,Okay.
Mitchell,"Where we going? Oh, this way?"
Gloria,"Manny, you don't sound very happy for a kid that is flying an elephant."
Manny,I lost to Durkas. It's not fair. He wanted to buy IBM because he thought it was funny to say.
Gloria,"Well, I'm glad that you lost. Fake money has changed you. Where is the Manny that used to stop to smell the roses?"
Manny,He took a bath on a solar start-up in San Jose.
Gloria,"You have been so busy burying your face in your phone that you barely said hello to your family, you gave Winnie the Pooh the cold shoulder, and you haven't even noticed that pretty girl in the blue elephant that has been smiling at you."
Manny,"Not my type, but still it's nice to be noticed."
Gloria,You see what happens when you're not burying your head in business?
Manny,You're right. I'll try to be more present. What the heck's on your feet?
Gloria,They're slippers! They're like pillows.
Jay,Attagirl. You're welcome.
Cameron,"Look. Your dad got her baby high heels, which we said we were never gonna let her wear."
Cameron,"You look gorgeous, sweetie. Oh, my gosh. You felt people judged us before? Wait till they meet little Miss Anaheim."
Mitchell,"Who cares? Look at her. She can barely move. Thank you, dad."
Jay,You know what? She's got pretty good gams for a 3-year-old.
Haley,Cheese!
Haley,Thank you!
Haley,Okay.
Haley,Why are you dancing like that?
Haley,"Well, I'm not talking to you."
Haley,"I know, but I'm mad. You came back to town and didn't even call me."
Haley,But the four dweebs on a bike act?
Haley,"Nothing. Dylan ; I still love her, Ethan."
Haley,"Dylan, let's not do this now."
Haley,You...
Claire,"Ethan? Ethan, what is going on? What are you doing?"
Claire,No.
Cameron,"Come on, Lily sweetie. Keep up, honey."
Claire,"Come on. Phil, you don't look like you're doing very well."
Phil,Maybe because I officially became an old man back there at Thunder Mountain.
Claire,"Oh, my goodness. You are burning up. You might have the flu."
Phil,"A bunch of guys at work had the flu, and we all drink orange juice out of the same carton. We should get cups. Luke, did you hear that?! I have the flu!"
Jay,Glad we didn't share that pickle.
Haley,"Hey, everybody."
Alex,"Oh, hey, hey, guys. Where's Ethan?"
Haley,"Oh, he's staying. He ran into some friends. But Dylan got fired, so... don't freak out. We have to give him a ride home. And we're back together."
Phil,Yay.
Jay,"Hey, no one goes home till we hit the Lincoln thing."
Luke,Yawn.
Claire,Don't even try to fight it.
Mitchell,"Yeah, he made us go when we were kids."
Jay,"Come on, people! It's a robotic president! What's not to love?"
Luke,A robotic president?
Jay,"So my plan was, drive Claire and Mitchell home, put them to bed, pour myself a big tumbler of scotch, and tell Dede it was over. But on the way out, we made one last stop."
Jay,"I don't know what happened. Maybe it's what robot Lincoln said about a man's duty or keeping the union together. Maybe I just chickened out. But I realized that staying with my kids was more important than leaving my wife. Now that's not the right decision for everyone, but it was the right decision for me."
Jay,So I stuck it out until they were grown...
Gloria,"Jay, you want to join me in the jacuzzi?"
Jay,And the universe rewarded me.
Luke,"Here we go! Hey, dad, roller coast fist bump. What was that? Is this gonna be so awesome! Close your eyes. It makes it more fun."
Phil,"Oh, yeah. That is more fun."
Claire,"Phil, honey, you're still up."
Phil,"Okay, how does this sound? Mitchell, I love you very much, I not only love you, but admire you, and someday I hope to..."
Claire,"Are you firing him or proposing to him? Honey, this was supposed to be a part-time job. He was gonna be done in the summer anyway. Just be direct."
Phil,I should have warned him. How do you tell someone they have a reputation for being lazy?
Claire,Mitchell? Lazy?
Phil,"Yeah. Yeah. He handed in a couple of contracts late, but I didn't want to say anything because he's practically doing this for free. I can't do this! This isn't the face of a cold-blooded hatchet man. Will you do it?"
Alex,Hey.
Claire,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did we wake you up?"
Alex,"No, I was up. I'm worried about tomorrow."
Alex,"My art teacher acts like I don't exist, but I have one last chance to impress him at our year-end art fair. A few students are doing living versions of famous paintings. I've chosen this one, and I'm using my own family. Brilliant, right? When I told him, he said, ""that's nice, Alice."" It's been a year. Alice? Really?"
Claire,"Honey, do you think you're nervous because you've got a little crush on Mr. Jarvis?"
Alex,No.
Claire,Are you sure? Because I've seen the way you look at him...
Alex,Sounds like you're the one with the crush! I've just never had a teacher not like me before.
Phil,"Well, Ms. Davis."
Claire,Mm.
Alex,Please. She's a gym teacher. She is to teaching what Dr. Seuss is to medicine.
Claire,And to think she didn't like you. You? What's your problem?
Luke,Nothing. I'm just excited for tomorrow.
Luke,I'm getting a medal at school because I put out a fire. Maybe that's what I should be when I grow up... A professional medal-getter.
Luke,I don't know. I was just walking by and I smelled flames.
Manny,I was there.
Manny,I don't like this. We're not supposed to be in here.
Luke,"Just keep a lookout! We're ten seconds away from creating luketonium. Oh, crap!"
Manny,Look what you did!
Luke,I don't know. I was just walking by and I smelled flames.
Claire,"Okay, guys, you're gonna be dragging tomorrow if you don't go to bed right now. Let's go. Go."
Luke,"Fine. Come on, Alice."
Phil,"I'll be up in a minute. ""Mitchell, I can't tell you how hard... How hard this..."" No, that's... no, it's not personal enough. Okay, okay. ""I can't tell you how hurt and angry this makes me, but you've been late too many times. I'll need your keys."""
Haley,"Daddy, no! I'm so sorry!"
Phil,"Honey, I didn't hear you come downstairs. You couldn't sleep, either?"
Haley,"Uh, yeah. No, there's just, like, a lot on my mind with graduation, and what to wear. How does this look?"
Phil,Wait a second. You're carrying your shoes. How am I supposed to judge the whole outfit? Put 'em on.
Jay,"So make sure you give this menu here a good, thorough reading."
Gloria,Soup.
Jay,You didn't even look at it.
Gloria,Soup.
Jay,Check out what's below the soup... Sandwiches.
Gloria,Have you check out what is below this outfit? This doesn't come from sandwiches.
Jay,Look!
Gloria,"""The Jay Pritchett""? I don't understand. They named you after a sandwich?"
Jay,No! They named a sandwich after me!
Gloria,"""Turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, red peppers, anchovies on wheat""?"
Jay,"Most people would stop after the salty bacon, but I double down with the anchovies."
Gloria,Were you making a sandwich or attracting deer?
Jay,"Oh, I should get a picture of this... an actual waitress sighting in this dump."
Gloria,What's happening?
Jay,"Gloria, it's Maxine."
Gloria,"No, no, I'm not, um... Okay, I get it. I get it."
Jay,Thanks.
Gloria,What's wrong with your neck?
Gloria,Audit?
Jay,It's nothing.
Jay,Look at it... my prettiest child.
Gloria,Why didn't you tell me about your neck?
Jay,It's fine. Take a bite.
Gloria,Your company's getting audited?
Jay,"Nothing! Three bad days, then it's over. Come on! I'm... I'm anxious to hear what you think. I see it growing on ya. It's like Maxine when she first tried it. You know, she..."
Gloria,I don't like it.
Jay,You probably didn't get all...
Gloria,"Jay, I try it. I don't like it."
Jay,That's all you can say?
Gloria,It tastes bad in my mouth. It's like a fish and a Turkey beat themselves to death with a pepper.
Jay,"Okay, fair enough. Maybe a little picky, though, from someone who prepared a Colombian specialty and said, ""why are you not eating the hooves? They're the best part."""
Cameron,I'm back!
Haley,"Oh, hey, Uncle Cam."
Cameron,"Oh, thanks again for picking me up last night. You're welcome, but you have to be more careful."
Haley,"I was the responsible one. Lisa was drinking, and I took her keys, and then e..."
Cameron,"I understand. My senior year, I had a pretty crazy night myself involving a bottle of corn mash and an overturned plow."
Haley,Seriously?
Cameron,Yeah. You don't know terror until you've had to stare down the eyes of a Missouri State Trooper and talk your way out of a P.U.I.
Claire,"Honey, you don't drink coffee."
Alex,"I do when I've been up half the night worrying about a project that's only one-third done, and I still have an apron to sew, scenery to paint, plus my normal crushing workload. So... Unless you have a better way for me to stimula... Oh, God. God, coffee's bitter."
Claire,That was your first sip?
Cameron,"Okay, I got the chafing dish, salt and pepper shakers... perfect matches, both. I may have to readjust my grapes."
Claire,Oh. Ow. I'll just give you a little privacy. Welcome back to the light show. Hi.
Cameron,"Hi, Lily."
Claire,"Lily... Sweetheart, no. No, no, no, no. We're... we're not gonna do that today."
Cameron,"Actually... actually, Claire, we're... we're trying not to use the word ""no"" so much. We just read a book that said children learn to rebel against that word."
Claire,Uh-huh.
Cameron,"So we redirect her into a new activity instead. Oh. Here... well, just watch this. Lily, sweetie, hi. It's daddy here. Would you like to listen to some music? Okay. There you go. See?"
Claire,"Every new generation thinks they have cracked the code on child rearing. What's the latest theory? Never say ""no."" I say ""no"" every day in this house."
Phil,"But at night, she's a ""yes"" machine."
Claire,No.
Claire,"Oh, it doesn't seem that she is redirecting her own energy as much as using a lot of ours."
Cameron,But do you see how she's slowly transitioning from the lights to the music?
Claire,"Yeah. Yeah, I do. It's hard to believe there was ever a time when we just said, ""stop doing that."" Oh. The garbage disposal. Lily, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now let's redirect you into a nap, huh?"
Cameron,"Actually, we're doing this new thing where we let her tell us when she wants to take a nap."
Claire,Uh-huh.
Cameron,"It's called ""being your own nap Captain."" Come on, sweetie."
Phil,Hey! Hey.
Mitchell,Phil. Hey. Did you ring the doorbell?
Phil,"Oh, no, 'cause I have these two coffees. One is for you."
Mitchell,Thank you.
Mitchell,"Here's my life... a full-time job, a 3-year-old, and a second one on the way. And as a favor, I agreed to do a little work for Phil's agency. The problem is, I'm very good, and the more I do, the more they want me. I-I even turned in a few assignments late so that they'd fall out of love with me a little bit."
Mitchell,Right. How... how long have you been standing here? Are... are you... are you all right?
Mitchell,'Cause you're... you're really blinking.
Phil,"I'm a stress blinker, um, and what really gets me going is confrontation. I hate it. I-I avoid it at all costs. Terrible at it. Once, I, uh, I tried to break up with a girl, and I danced around it so much, she didn't know I had broken up with her. 20 years later, we're still married."
Phil,I am... really... sorry... About the cold coffee.
Mitchell,"It's not that cold. It's lukewarm, so..."
Phil,"Funny story about that expression... when the kids were younger, um, we had a, uh, a wading pool... And occasionally, Luke would have an accident, and, um, Alex would scream, and we'd say, um, ""it's okay, honey, he's just making it lukewarm."" Wow, so..."
Mitchell,"So I gotta get going, but I-I'll see..."
Phil,"Okay, wait! I'm just gonna come straight out and say it. Mitchell, you've done a wonderful job for the agency since you decided you'd help us out for just a little bit. And we couldn't ask for more, could we? I wish it didn't have to end. In fact, if it was up to me, you'd stay on forever..."
Mitchell,"Phil, Phil..."
Phil,"But it is not just up to me, is it? So... I..."
Mitchell,"Phil, I saw this coming, and... and look..."
Mitchell,"I bailed. I made an excuse and left. But I-I-I've gotta be straight with him. ""Phil, I cannot stay on with your firm forever."" Oh! God, it's gonna crush him. Maybe I can get Claire to do it."
Phil,"Well, that was easy!"
Manny,You're not a hero.
Luke,I put out a fire.
Manny,A fire you started.
Luke,Was there a fire?
Manny,Yes.
Luke,Did I put it out?
Manny,That's not...
Luke,Answer the question.
Manny,Yes.
Luke,"I'm getting an award for it. If they gave awards for starting fires, I'd be getting one of those, too."
Manny,"I know you have a conscience, Luke. Do you see this flag? It stands for Justice. So when that fire marshall gets here, I know you're going to look at that flag and do the right thing."
Gloria,You were very quiet all the way home. Are you upset at me because I honked at that old lady?
Jay,"Normally, we leave the honking to the driver, but I'm used to it."
Gloria,Is it because of the sandwich?
Jay,"Ah, you maybe could have eaten half of it... Said a couple of nice things."
Gloria,"It's just a sandwich, Jay."
Jay,"It's not about the delicious sandwich, Gloria. It's about being respectful of a person's feelings."
Gloria,But I was just being honest.
Jay,"You don't have to be honest about every little thing in a relationship. Some things you say, some things you don't."
Gloria,Oh? What are the things that you don't say?
Jay,"Gloria, I really don't wanna do this anymore."
Gloria,"Oh, really? But you cannot just try to teach me a lesson, and then not even..."
Jay,"Okay, fine. I don't say this, but it... bothers me a little bit that you're just a tiny bit... loud."
Gloria,Loud?
Jay,"Not all the time. Only when you, you know, when you talk."
Gloria,So I embarrass you?
Jay,Gloria...
Gloria,What? Am I being too loud again?
Jay,All right. Buckle up.
Gloria,"Oh, I'm gonna go and try to do the laundry, and I'm gonna do it very quietly so I don't bother you. Maybe Manny can help me. Manny!"
Jay,I get it.
Gloria,Manny!
Jay,I get it. Now you're not even making any noise.
Alex,"Okay, this is way too many grapes, and this spoon is modern day, so if we use it, everyone at the table has to react in shock at the spoon from the future. Okay."
Claire,And that went down the drain.
Alex,And you need a nap.
Cameron,"I got it. Ooh, I lost it. Shoot."
Claire,Let me know if I can eliminate any distractions for you.
Cameron,"Oh, I got it. No, I got a finger on it. There it is. Oh, lost it again."
Claire,"Maybe you should just wait until it comes to you. You know, make it the Captain of its own spoon platoon."
Cameron,"I understand the point you're making, Claire, but... Oh! Now I'm stuck."
Claire,"Yeah, Cam, you are stuck. You are stuck on a philosophy that clearly doesn't work. Sometimes, you need to say ""no"" to a child."
Cameron,"Yeah, and sometimes you need to say ""no"" to an adult. No, Claire. No, I don't need help raising my child."
Claire,"Oh. Okay. Sorry. Guess I-I do have a lot to learn. Right now, I-I'm looking forward to learning if you will get your arm out of there before Lily gets to the garbage disposal switch."
Cameron,"Um... Lily, sweetie! C-can you do something, please, Claire?"
Claire,"I would like to. Really, I would, but I would probably just say ""no"" and shred her confidence and mangle her self-esteem."
Cameron,"Okay, fine! I'm sorry! Just... here. Stop her! Stop her! Sweetie!"
Claire,What to do with you?
Cameron,Claire! Okay!
Claire,Ohh! Yes!
Cameron,"You think that's funny, don't ya?"
Claire,Yes!
Cameron,"Yes. Well, it's wicked, Claire. It's wicked. Come on. We're leaving, Lily! Lily!"
Phil,"It's living art. We stay perfectly still for 90 seconds, basically doing nothing."
Phil,As long as you both agree it was only 90 seconds. Two nerds with one stone! I love working in an office.
Phil,"I did, before work."
Phil,"No, he always looks like that. Hey. How's it going?"
Mitchell,"Hey, hey. Listen... Okay, I know this is uncomfortable... but we really need to talk about my future here."
Phil,But I-I-I thought we...
Mitchell,"No, I know. I know I led you to believe that I'd be able to stay on here indefinitely, and... and... O-okay, don't get all blinky."
Phil,Oh.
Mitchell,"No, it's not all bad news, okay?"
Phil,Okay.
Mitchell,"You will have me until July, like we agreed."
Phil,"Okay, great."
Mitchell,Yes.
Phil,"Hey, could you jump on the elevator with me real quick? Yes. Yes. I could use a hand carrying up some stuff from my car. Oh! My goodness. I probably need some empty boxes, don't I? You know what? You head down, I'll meet you at the glass doors. There was something else. What was it? I know it's in there. Oh, yeah, you're fired."
Mitchell,What? F-fired?! W-what's going on with these things? You trying to open 'em?
Phil,Mm-hmm. I guess I better... get somebody.
Mitchell,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... you're firing me? I-I don't even like this job."
Phil,That can't be safe.
Mitchell,Lazy?!
Phil,You handed in a couple of things late. I should have warned you. I'm terrible at breaking bad news.
Mitchell,"Well, then why did you come over to my house and tell me how great I was?"
Phil,That was me trying to fire you! I haven't felt like this since I tried to break up with Claire 20 years ago.
Phil,"They said it was your attitude, like you were doing us a favor."
Mitchell,I was doing you a favor!
Phil,"Don't worry, he can't get you."
Mitchell,Two hours I got stuck in there with an entire office of people staring at me. I finally had to lie down. Didn't help my reputation.
Phil,"You guys nailed it. Dude, that was surreal. Get it?"
Alex,"Dad, come on! We have a minute to set up! Where are Mitchell and Cam?"
Luke,"Hey, Manny. Thanks for what you said before about the flag. It really got me thinking."
Manny,"I knew you had a conscience, Luke. And more importantly, you've got a good... You didn't."
Luke,"Yep. And thanks to you, I had them move the ceremony to right under the flag. I'll sign a picture for you."
Alex,"Oh, there you are. I was afraid you weren't coming."
Cameron,It was a discussion.
Mitchell,"If we weren't gonna show up, we would have clearly let you know, and not humiliated you in public."
Phil,"If it's any consolation, the lawyer we hired to replace you is already suing the elevator company."
Haley,Ow. You're sitting on my hand.
Cameron,Be thankful you have two. I almost lost one today.
Claire,"Oh, stop being such a baby. She was nowhere near that switch."
Alex,Shh! Keep your voices down. We're about to go on.
Gloria,Why you looking at me? Am I too loud? Is that what everybody thinks?
Alex,What?
Jay,There's a backstory here you don't wanna know about.
Jay,"Save your appetite, baby girl. And don't forget, afterwards, we're going to Lenny's for a bite to eat... more than a bite if you value my feelings."
Claire,"Oh! Great, we get to see Maxine."
Gloria,"What? You know Maxine, too?"
Mitchell,"Oh, we all know Maxine. Love."
Phil,"Second-best hugger in the world, after Mr. Burt Reynolds. Story to follow."
Alex,"All right, guys, this will all be over in 90 seconds. Hold your poses."
Cameron,Okay.
Alex,I really wanna impress Mr. Gorgeous. Jarvis! Shut up.
Phil,"Hey, Mitch, I know this isn't a good time, I-I just want you to know, I'm really..."
Mitchell,"I know, Phil. You're really sorry, okay? But this is gonna take me a little time to get over, all right?"
Phil,"Actually, I was gonna say I'm really gonna need your parking pass."
Mitchell,What?!
Manny,"How do you sleep at night, Luke?"
Luke,With a medal around my neck.
Alex,Shh!
Alex,"Lily, no!"
Claire,She doesn't understand that word.
Cameron,"Cram it, Claire."
Claire,"Control your child, Cam. It's not that difficult. I've raised three."
Cameron,Really?
Alex,Cam!
Cameron,Why don't you ask Haley what time she got home last night?
Haley,Uncle Cam!
Cameron,"Sorry, dear. Collateral damage."
Claire,What is he talking about?
Alex,Shh!
Jay,Your arms are shaking.
Gloria,"Oh, yeah, I'm sure that the great Maxine can do a better job!"
Claire,"You can criticize my parenting all you like, Cam, but my son just won a medal."
Manny,"For a fire he started. Claire ! Luke, is that true?"
Gloria,How long? It's getting heavy!
Mitchell,You're not getting that parking pass back.
Phil,I tried to let you down easy.
Mitchell,"You don't know how to talk to people, Phil. It's just like when Claire didn't even know you dumped her."
Claire,What?
Haley,When did dad dump you?
Phil,I didn't dumpped her! I just tried to!
Gloria,I am losing it!
Alex,Just a few more seconds!
Cameron,We really are trying to not say that word.
Alex,"B-minus, but there was a silver lining. ""I expected more, Alex."" Alex!"
Claire,I am gonna call Haley and tell her we're not going to that deli. I can't take another minute of Cam.
Cameron,"You know, I'm not even sure I believe all these new parenting theories, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna let her tell me they're wrong."
Mitchell,We are not going to dinner.
Gloria,I tried that sandwich. It's not that good. You're not missing anything.
Manny,I sure won't miss seeing Luke and that stupid medal. I play by the rules. Where's my medal?
Gloria,Jay can stay with that Maxine. She's not loud like me.
Phil,"In fairness, you can be a little quick to give advice."
Claire,"Well, I'm always ready to help, if that's what you mean, yeah."
Phil,"Yeah, but if you're not careful, it can come off a little... Know-it-all-y."
Claire,"That's not a word. What you mean to say is, it can come off like I know it all. I've always been this way."
Phil,That's why I wanted to break up with you.
Mitchell,"The word ""fired"" doesn't even apply. You can't get fired from a favor."
Cameron,"Okay, sweetie, maybe you should just let it go. Like I always say, it's better to carry a tune than a grudge."
Mitchell,"Okay, you... You've never said that, but... And... and what about this grudge you're holding against Claire? I don't see you trading that in for a tune."
Cameron,That is completely different. She insulted my parenting skills.
Mitchell,"Which, you have to admit, you can be pretty defensive about."
Cameron,"Okay, so maybe we both can be a little sensitive."
Mitchell,"N-no. No. Mnh-mnh. No. These... these are... these are not equal. No, you have no idea what it feels like to be fired."
Cameron,"Yes, I do. I've been fired. Everyone has."
Mitchell,Not me.
Cameron,Never?
Mitchell,"No. Nope, I've always been very good at what I do."
Cameron,So then maybe what you're feeling is a little insecure about your work for the first time.
Mitchell,That's hogwash.
Cameron,"As someone who's seen actual hogwash, I can assure you that it's not."
Manny,I don't know why you're so bothered by Maxine. She's nice.
Gloria,"Oh, good! Why don't you, Jay, and Maxine live together, eating sandwiches forever?!"
Manny,"Can I float a theory here, mom? You sound like you're jealous."
Gloria,"Please! Me jealous of that woman? I just don't like the way they talk to each other! And the little jokes, and she knows everything about his life! Just makes me feel like, em... Is that jealous? Ay, my poor sisters."
Jay,"Who knows what they're doing? Right now, they're all sniping at each other."
Jay,"Right. As long as I have you, Maxine..."
Claire,"Well, he set fire to a school and lied about it."
Jay,You know they give medals for anything these days.
Claire,It's going back tomorrow. He doesn't get a lot of medals.
Phil,I just really need one of these. Hey. Don't hold back.
Jay,My girls. There they are.
Jay,"Hey, Cam. Come on in!"
Phil,"I, uh, I appreciate your coming. And, again, I really, really... thank you."
Mitchell,Yeah.
Jay,There she is.
Gloria,"Hola, Maxine. So nice to see you."
Gloria,We don't need it. It's Jay Pritchetts all around!
Jay,"Gloria, if you want your sandwich without anchovies, I won't be offended."
Gloria,"Aw. Of course, then it'll be a Jack Feldman."
Phil,Hey.
Mitchell,Hmm?
Phil,"Hey, man."
Mitchell,Is the repair guy here?
Phil,"He's working on it. Um, listen, uh, it's Katie's birthday, skip's assistant. Big 3-0. Still no ring."
Mitchell,You woke me up to tell me that?
Phil,"No, no. I-I grabbed you some cake."
Mitchell,"Oh, sure it's not for employees only?"
Phil,Okay. Had that coming.
Phil,Mitchell.
Phil,"Mitchell, my br... uh, the lazy guy."
Mitchell,"I was doing you a favor. All right, just give me the cake. I'm hungry. No! Oh."
Cameron,"One, two, three, four. And skip, two, three, four. And turn, two, three, four."
Cameron,"Well, honey, if you spot the wall, then you won't get dizzy. Here, watch daddy, okay?"
Mitchell,How cool would it be if you turned into wonder woman right now?
Cameron,Can't even talk about it.
Mitchell,"Oh, it's the adoption agency."
Cameron,"Oh, my gosh. It is?! It is?! It is?!"
Mitchell,"Cam, you need to stop doing that. Last time, they were just calling to confirm our billing address. Hello? Uh-huh."
Cameron,"""Uh-huh"" what?"
Mitchell,Yep. Really?
Cameron,"""Really"" what?"
Mitchell,"That... that mother from Calexico, she picked us."
Cameron,She did?
Mitchell,Uh-huh. She... she went into early labor. She's having the baby today.
Cameron,She is?!
Mitchell,Uh-huh. We have to go to Calexico right now.
Cameron,We do?!
Mitchell,Just assume everything I say is the truth.
Cameron,"Okay, yeah."
Mitchell,"Okay. Oh, okay, yes. Well, thank you so much. Okay, bye. Um... we're getting a baby today."
Cameron,"Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Ohh!"
Mitchell,"Wait, wait, wait. What do we do about Lily's recital?"
Cameron,"Um... well, you know what? We'll... we'll just sit her down. We'll... we'll tell her. We'll... We'll give her a popsicle. She'll be fine."
Mitchell,"Yeah, l..."
Cameron,We have to do this.
Mitchell,"Okay, okay. Yeah, you're right um, all right, I'm gonna go dig up the old car seat. And listen, let's just... Take a deep breath before we tell anyone, okay?"
Cameron,Yeah.
Gloria,Jay! Manny! Good news! Mitch and Cam are getting a new baby today!
Jay,Really? That's fantastic.
Gloria,And it's Latino!
Jay,How's that giant fence working out for ya?
Gloria,It's Claire. Hello? Did you hear?
Mitchell,"Hey, Claire."
Claire,"You are driving to some California border town to adopt a baby, and I have to hear about it from Gloria?"
Mitchell,I was outside for two minutes.
Cameron,I kept it in as long as I could. We're having a baby!
Phil,"Oh, ho ho ho!"
Luke,What the heck is that?
Phil,What?!
Claire,We're back. We got Alex the cutest prom dress. Show your dad.
Phil,"Hey. Well, I don't like how far down that zipper goes, but on the plus side, it looks water-resistant."
Luke,I can't believe Haley's not going to the prom and Alex is.
Alex,What's that supposed to mean?
Phil,"I know I keep saying it, Haley, but you should be going. It's a major moment in a teenager's life, and you're missing it."
Haley,Proms are lame. It's just an excuse for dressed up dorks to ride in limos and hump each other.
Phil,Okay. Now I don't like the idea of Alex going.
Claire,"Sweetie, I think we're fine. It's... it's Alex."
Alex,What's that supposed to mean?
Luke,It means you're a geek.
Alex,You know what? You know what? I might just go crazy tonight and... and... and hook up all over him.
Claire,Mm-hmm. Okay.
Alex,Why are you laughing? That's not funny. I'm not even gonna wear my glasses!
Claire,Oh.
Phil,I feel better now.
Claire,Mm.
Haley,"All right, I'm going to the mall."
Claire,"Um, we need to talk, honey. We're worried about you. You haven't heard back from the college that wait-listed you, and all the rest of your friends have. And now you're just wasting time at the mall."
Haley,"For your information, I've already filled out and dropped off my community college application. And plus also I'm going to the mall because I have a job interview."
Phil,What?
Claire,Really?
Haley,"My guidance counselor suggested I take a gap year. You know, a year between high school and college were you take some courses, have some life experiences, and get inspired. And obviously, work at the GAP."
Jay,The first step in plane building... Organize the parts. You got your power plant. You got your fuselage. You got your control surfaces. What's that?
Manny,"A charcuterie. You got your prosciutto, your pancetta, your salami."
Jay,That's charcuterie? I've been avoiding that on menus for years. They're killing themselves with that name.
Gloria,They're here! They're here!
Mitchell,Hi! Thank you so much for doing this. Thank you. Thank you.
Gloria,Of course.
Cameron,"Okay, so her recital's at 6:00. That's the address. Here's her outfit. This is our camcorder. Get the whole show and some backstage color."
Manny,"Guys, you wanna take our charcuterie for the road?"
Jay,"Bup, bup, bup, bup. They're good. We may need that."
Mitchell,"Hello? Yeah, um... H-hold on one second, I think it's the baby's family. They're speaking Spanish. I..."
Cameron,"Hola, soy Cameron. ¿Cómo está? Uh, b... Excuse me. Could you s... Could you slow down just a little bit? What does frenético mean?"
Gloria,It's when...
Mitchell,Or just let her do it. Yeah. There you go.
Gloria,"Okay. Hello? Sí, sí. Yo los puedo ayudar..."
Cameron,I was doing fine.
Mitchell,"He thinks he's some sort of an expert because for the past two weeks, he's been watching this ridiculous Spanish soap opera."
Jay,"""Fire And Ice""? Don't say a word about the ending of last night's episode. G-Gloria watches that. You'll ruin it."
Gloria,"Sí. Van a estar esperando su llamada, muchísimas gracias. It was the mother's sister Juanita. She said that she doesn't know the exact hospital yet, but that she will call you, like, in the next hour."
Mitchell,"Oh, thank you, Gloria. I-I hate to ask this of you, but would you mind coming with us? We need someone who actually knows how to speak Spanish."
Cameron,Frío. Muy frío.
Gloria,"Ay, yes, of course! I would love to! Thank you! Thank you! I'm gonna grab my stuff, and we go, okay?"
Mitchell,"All right, sweetheart. All right, come here. Daddies gotta go, okay? All right."
Cameron,"Okay, we're so sorry we're missing your recital, sweetie. But you know what? You're getting a brand-new baby brother!"
Mitchell,"Cam, come on. Come on."
Cameron,"Mwah! Okay. All right, breathe, breathe, breathe."
Gloria,"Ciao, Jay! Ciao, Manny! I see you later, okay?"
Jay,What just happened here?
Manny,She's talking to you.
Jay,You wanna take that?
Phil,"Always keep the rhythm in your feet. Then we're gonna add just a little party in the shoulders. All right? Now let's get those arms going. No, no, no. Arms down here says, ""I'm white and I'm sorry,"" but arms up here says, ""You don't know what I am."""
Alex,I-I don't.
Haley,"You're never gonna believe it! You're never gonna believe it! You're never gonna believe it! Guess who got a job! I did! Oh, shoot. I just told you."
Claire,"Oh! Honey, congratulations!"
Phil,That's amazing!
Claire,You got a job! And what is all this?
Haley,I stopped by the grocery store to get some stuff for dinner.
Claire,You know where the grocery store is?
Haley,"Yes, mother. I'm celebrating by making dinner for me and Dylan tonight. Would you and dad like to join us?"
Claire,What's happening?
Phil,I don't know.
Haley,"Tonight at dinner, I'm telling my parents the biggest news of all. After graduation, I'm moving in with someone."
Jay,"Honey, you don't need to practice anymore. The turning, the jumping, the little bird thing... You've got it."
Jay,"Sweetie, please don't play with the pieces. I've told you, they're very delicate."
Manny,It's a model of a plane that was built for Amelia Earhart.
Jay,Because she wanted to fly around the world.
Jay,Because she problem needed to get away from her kids.
Jay,You know how to stop this?
Manny,"I'm on it. Lily, we really need you to let us concentrate for a few minutes, okay?"
Manny,"Um, now I'm flustered."
Claire,"Oh, you look adorable!"
Alex,"""Adorable""? I'm not a puppy."
Claire,"Oh, honey, it was meant as a compliment."
Phil,"Claire, I got this. Honey, you look super sexy."
Alex,Ew.
Phil,"Well, we tried everything."
Alex,"Oh, good-bye!"
Phil,"Wait! Wait, wait! We wanna meet this Casanova."
Alex,"Oh, no, parents aren't really his scene."
Claire,"Alex, open the door. We are going to get a picture."
Alex,Fine.
Alex,Thanks.
Phil,"Hi, buddy."
Claire,Hi.
Alex,"Yes, my bad boy prom date is gay. He just doesn't know it yet, so I'm basically his beard. Pre-beard. His stubble."
Phil,"Okay, say ""cheese""!"
Alex,Cheese.
Phil,"Okay, now one with flash."
Alex,Cheese.
Alex,"Okay, I think you got the picture."
Phil,"Well, you guys have fun."
Claire,"Do you want me to touch up your hair, honey?"
Gloria,"Ay, please stop driving the car like a snake. It's making me nauseating."
Mitchell,"Well, uh, if you want to switch places, there's plenty of room to stretch out back here."
Cameron,"Yeah, that's why we traded our old prius in for the new one. You know, bigger family, bigger backseat. You can fit two car seats and a prize- winning pig back there."
Mitchell,Please don't put a pig in the backseat with our children.
Cameron,"I'm not being literal. It's a unit of measurement we used on the farm. You know, like, ""that bed's a double-pigger."" Oh, uh, sorry. Maybe think about something else. You know, I missed ""Fire And Ice"" on Monday. What happened?"
Mitchell,My guess is a bunch of ridiculous plot turns done by overwrought actors who are impossibly good-looking.
Cameron,Don't listen to him.
Gloria,"Nothing, really. Antonio hired a hooker to marry his father so that he can get back the money, but the hooker ended up being his long lost sister, the former beauty queen."
Mitchell,"Oh. Well, I stand uncorrected."
Gloria,"Ay, please just drive straighter."
Cameron,"Oh, sorry. Are my pinkies up again? I... They do that when I get excited. Down, girls!"
Phil,"Well, Alex should be hitting the dance floor right about now. Must be fun."
Haley,"Really, dad, let it go."
Phil,"I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm just sad you're missing it. I can still totally picture my prom night. My date was Angela Wilkins. My dad dressed as a limo driver and spoke with a British accent. He even announced our arrival. ""Sir Philliam Dunphy and the Lady Wilkins!"""
Claire,Ahem.
Phil,All the cool kids were totally laughing with us.
Claire,"Oh, I'm just so glad we met after that."
Phil,"Oh. Me, too. Wonder what ever happened to Angela?"
Phil,"I haven't seen her in over 20 years, but that's what's special about prom. No matter what... The Lady Wilkins and I will always have that night."
Haley,"Oh, no, no, no! We got this. We'll clean."
Phil,Oh. Uh...
Claire,"Oh. You're cleaning up? What kind of day is this? Cam and Mitch get a new son, we get a new daughter."
Phil,"That was really fun, you guys."
Luke,I'm in. Just give me a heads-up.
Claire,"""Our place""?"
Haley,"Um, well, since I have a job now and I'm going to community college, uh, Dylan and I were thinking that, you know, we would get an apartment together."
Claire,What?
Luke,Are you doing sex?
Phil,"Luke, can we have a minute, please?"
Claire,Um...
Claire,"Dylan, would you excuse us for a moment so we can talk to Haley?"
Mitchell,"Hi. Uh, uh, buenos noches. Uh, uh, we're looking for... Uh, English? Uh, well, Juanita. We're looking for Juanita."
Mitchell,Hi.
Gloria,"Ah, she says, ""Hello, Mitch and Cameron."""
Cameron,I think we got that.
Gloria,"Ay, you brought me here."
Gloria,"Ay, ¡qué bueno! Did you get that, too?"
Cameron,"Yeah, a lot of it. Mm-hmm."
Mitchell,Just... Just tell us.
Gloria,"The baby was born half-hour ago, that he's in perfect health. He was 7 pounds, 4 ounces, with thick hair and brown eyes."
Mitchell,That's so good!
Cameron,So good.
Mitchell,"Gloria, what's going on?"
Gloria,I don't know. The priest comes with great warning.
Cameron,That can't be good.
Gloria,Shh! Something about the grandmother. She's sick.
Cameron,Ohh.
Gloria,But now she's better.
Mitchell,Oh.
Gloria,And now she knows!
Mitchell,Knows what?
Mitchell,What was that for?!
Cameron,The nurse stole her grandmother's almonds.
Gloria,"No, the nurse is mad at Juanita because Juanita stole her lover, and Juanita is mad at the nurse because the nurse told the grandmother about the baby!"
Cameron,Our baby?
Mitchell,Our baby?
Manny,We're both thinking it. I'm just gonna say it. Lily's dance is not up to the standard of what we just saw.
Jay,"In my head, I'm golfing right now."
Jay,"Oh, the poor thing. You get the kid, I'll get the car."
Manny,"You know she stinks, right?"
Jay,Lily. Your teacher tells me you don't want to dance. Is that true? But you were so good back at the house when you were practicing.
Jay,"Ah, to your house, huh? Are you sad your dads aren't here? Yeah. Well, I know they're sad to miss this, but they're getting you that baby brother. That's good, right? You know, honey, your dads are gonna love you just as much when you get this brother. Trust me. I first had your aunt Claire, and then your dad came along, and I loved them just the same, no matter what he tells you. You believe me? Close enough. So what do you say? You gonna go out there and dance for everybody?"
Jay,"Honey, there must be something I can do to get you out there."
Jay,"No, honey, that's not gonna happen. How about I give you 50 bucks?"
Haley,I don't see why I can't do this. I'm totally getting my life together.
Claire,"Uh, allow me, if you will, to paint an accurate picture of this life you think you want, okay?"
Phil,Yeah.
Claire,"Um, at first, it's a blast, buying a dish rack, hanging a sheet up to turn one room into two."
Phil,Allen-wrenching a bookcase called a Nurnk...
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Phil,Because you couldn't afford the Sklurg.
Claire,"But then... Then those bills start rollingin... So you gotta pick up some extra shifts. Yeah. And suddenly... Uh-oh, what's that? You're pregnant."
Phil,Should've been safe.
Claire,"Ooh, and you're stressed and exhausted. You've got a garage filled with unsold huge t-shirts. And, honey, if you think this kind of stress is not gonna take its toll on that body and that face, think again. Good-bye, beautiful skin. Farewell, silky hair. And hello, Alex's hand-me-downs, 'cause you can't afford to shop."
Phil,Good one.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Luke,"Yes. Well, for my parents, I mean. For you? No."
Luke,"Don't worry. I got your back, buddy. That's not gonna happen."
Luke,"Dylan, shut the door. The bedroom door."
Cameron,Excuse me. Excuse me. Okay. We're very confused. Can somebody please just tell us what's happening?
Gloria,"Somebody told the grandmother about the baby, and she wasn't supposed to know. If you ask me, it was the sexy priest."
Mitchell,Oh! What's happening?
Gloria,"Ay, wait a minute. Now I go from English to Spanish. Que él no está muerto..."
Mitchell,C-can we please just see our baby?
Gloria,She's saying that she's going to raise the baby.
Cameron,No.
Mitchell,Cam.
Phil,"Guess what? Suddenly, you're 60 years old, wandering toothless and alone in a postapocalyptic wasteland."
Haley,Wait a second. How did Dylan get the nuclear codes again?
Phil,During the robot wars.
Claire,"Okay, I think your father might have gotten a little bit off-track here. Honey, listen, the point is, the choices you make today..."
Haley,"No, no, the point is, is that it doesn't have to turn out so bad."
Luke,This came yesterday.
Claire,What is it?
Claire,"Oh, d... Oh, my God.P You got into college?"
Phil,What?!
Claire,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Aah!"
Phil,That's amazing!
Claire,"It came yest... Yesterday? Luke, why were you hiding this?"
Luke,I don't know.
Phil,Do you not want her to go to college?
Luke,I don't care.
Haley,Aw! You're gonna miss me!
Luke,Shut up! I am not! I'm never telling you anything again.
Claire,"Oh, Dylan."
Phil,Really?
Claire,Oh.
Haley,Mom?
Claire,Yes.
Haley,Can I borrow that purple dress I said you were too old for?
Claire,"Mm, in spite of that, yeah. Yeah."
Phil,"Hey, buddy."
Phil,"Yeah, sure. I mean, it's the tux I got married in, so it's double-breasted."
Phil,Okay.
Gloria,I'm going to get something for my stomach.
Cameron,"Oh, come on, swipe. Swipe! M-Mitchell, I need your help. It won't swipe, and I'm in no condition to ""see cashier."" Mitchell. Mitchell. Mitchell? Mitch--Mitchell! Where are you going?!"
Mitchell,"I'm just sick of it, Cam."
Cameron,"Mitchell. Mitchell, come back here and talk to me. There are coyotes out here and... and meth addicts!"
Mitchell,"Every time, Cam. Every time someone says that we're getting a-a baby, I get my hopes up and then... And then when it all falls apart, I... We just have to go through the whole thing again. And then meanwhile, the child that we do have is... is at a recital, and... and we're missing it."
Cameron,I know. I'm as frustrated as you are.
Mitchell,Are you? Because I-I don't... I don't know how much more of this I can take. I am... I am so tired and... and just disappointed. And... I'm just tired.
Cameron,Then let's take a break.
Mitchell,Really?
Cameron,"It must be exhausting, always keeping it together for the both of us. And I'm tired, too."
Mitchell,I think I'm lying on a rock.
Cameron,I'm lying next to my rock.
Gloria,"There's certain moments in life that you never forget, like when I held Manny in my arms for the very first time. I was nervous. I didn't know what I was doing."
Haley,What do you think?
Phil,You guys look amazing.
Claire,"Oh, our little girl!"
Gloria,And I was so excited to see him grow up.
Claire,"Bye, sweetie."
Phil,"Have fun, man."
Jay,"She's asleep. I tell you, kid, I'm too old for this."
Manny,You and me both.
Gloria,"And the more he becomes the little man I know today, the more I know I would do it all over again... Which is good, because I'm going to do it all over again. Turns out that I wasn't carsick. I'm pregnant."
Phil,"Okay, Luke, let's see what else you've been hiding from us."
Luke,"Okay, fine. Here's a bill for the birdhouse I blew up at the Dude Ranch."
Claire,You blew up a birdhouse?
Luke,Let's hold all questions until the end. Here's dad's jury duty thing for the day we went to Disneyland. I didn't want you to cancel the trip.
Phil,Good call.
Luke,Here's a coupon for a gun range for mom. I don't know what that's about.
Claire,I don't know either. It's...
Luke,Report card.
Claire,Mm-hmm.
Luke,Report card. Notice from the city to take down the tree house or be fined $25 a day... Report card. Red light ticket from when me and Manny stole that...
